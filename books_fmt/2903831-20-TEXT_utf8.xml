When the crusading armies poured into Asia, this country became the grand theatre of the contes? between the armies of the Cross and the Crescent, and its plains were deluged witli Christian and Moslem blood. Antioch, under the Roman empire the magnificent and luxurious capital of the East, and, next to Rome and Alexandria, the greatest city in the empire, was the first object of the invaders. It sustained, in 1098, a protracted siege uninjured, during which the Christian camp experienced all the horrors of famine : carrion was openly dressed, and human flesh is said to have been eaten in secret. It fell at length through treachery: in the silence of the night, the croises commenced their indiscriminate butchery of its sleeping inhabitants. The dignity of age, the helplessness of infancy, and the beauty of the weaker sex, were, say the historians, alike disregarded by the Latin savages; and Greeks and Armenians were for some time, equally with the Mussulmans, exposed to their fury. More than ten thousand victims perished in this massacre. In the following spring, Jerusalem shared the same fate. On the erection of the transitory Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, the county of Tripoli formed a distinct but dependent principality. In the ecclesiastical division, Berytus, Sidon, Acre, and Panias, were episcopal sees in the province of Tyre. Tyre itself was a royal domain. The battle of Tiberias, in 1186, made the illustrious Saladin the master of these places; Jerusalem capitulated the following year, and Antioch submitted to the Moslem conqueror, who thus became lord of both Syria and Egypt. Syria remained subject to the Sultans of Egypt, till in 1517, Selim I. overthrew the Mamalouk dynasty, and Syria and Egypt became absorbed in the Ottoman empire."/>

A number of petty independent chiefs have sprung up, who have set the power of the sultan at defiance. Burckhardt states, that Badjazze, Alexandretta, and Antakia (Antioch), had each an independent aga. Berber, a formidable rebel who had fixed his seat at Tripoli, where he had maintained himself for six years, had been but recently subdued (in 1812) by the Pasha of Damascus. Aintab (to the north of Aleppo), as well as Edlip and Shogre (between Aleppo and Latikia), had also their own chiefs. The name of the Pasha of Aleppo is become little more than a vain title, the real power being in the hands of the janissaries, while the whole neighbourhood is infested by obscure tribes of Arab and Kourdish robbers. Throughout Syria, as is the case, indeed, with respect to the whole of Asiatic Turkey, the Turks do not form more than two-fifths of the population. All civil and military employments, however, are in their hands. Besides Turks, and those natives who may claim to be considered as of genuine Syrian extraction, the country is inhabited by Kourds, Turcomans, Bedouin Arabs, Chinganes, and other nomade hordes ; by Druses, Enzairies, and Motoualis ; by Maronites, Armenians, Greek Christians, and Jews. No country, perhaps, exhibits a greater variety in the character of its population. The old Syrian language is said to be spoken in a few districts, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Damascus and Mount Libanus. The Arabic predominates both in the country and the towns. A corrupt mixture of Syriac and Chaldee is spoken in some parts by the peasantry, while the Turkish is spoken by the Osmanlis and the nomade hordes of the north. These various nations and tribes will come more particularly under our notice in describing the districts to which they respectively belong. The most natural division of the country is that which corresponds to its present political distribution into pashalics, to which we shall accordingly adhere. The coast from Akka to Djebail, Avith the mountains inhabited by the Druses, is comprehended under the pashalic of Seide and Akka. Near Djebail, the pashalic of Tarabolos (Tripoli) begins, and extends along the coast to Latikia. The north of Syria, from the Levant to the Euphrates, is included within that of Haleb (Aleppo). The remainder of the country, including by far the largest territory, is the viceroyalty of the Pasha of Sham (Damascus)."/>

This pashalic, till the time of Djezzax• Pasha, took its name from Seide or Sidon, which formed its capital. It was composed of the country of the Druses, and of the coast from Nahr-el-Kelb to Mount Carmel. The celebrated Arab chieftain, known by the name of Sheikh Daher, pushed his conquests so far, however, into the territory of the Pasha of Sidon, that he left him at last only that town, and from this he was driven. But, on the fall of Daher, Djezzar, who succeeded the Sheikh as pasha, seized on all his dominions, and enlarged the boundaries of the pashalic by the annexation of the districts of Saphet, of Tiberias, and of Balbec, which had formerly belonged to Damascus, as well as of Cesarea. By this means, he reaped the benefit of the achievements of Daher, and Acre became from that time the capital of the province. As these events, though comparatively insignificant, are a specimen of the petty revolutions which are continually taking place within the Turkish empire, it may not be unacceptable to the reader to be put in possession of the outlines of the story, as told by Volney."/>

On the death of his father, which occurred towards the beginning of the last century, he shared the government with an uncle and two brothers. His domain was Szaffad. To this, shortly after, he added Tabaria, which Pococke, in 1737, found him occupied in fortifying against the Pasha of Damascus, who, a little time before, had caused one of his brothers to be strangled. In 1742, another pasha, named Soliman־el־Ahdm, besieged him here, and bombarded the place, to the astonishment of all Syria, which, at that time, had little acquaintance with such a mode of warfare. Daher, in spite of his courage, was daunted, and was at the last extx*emity, when a fortunate event extricated him from his embarrassment. A sudden attack of the cholic carried off Soliman in two days, and Asad־el־Ahdm, his brother and successor, had not the same reasons or the same inclination to continue the contest. Daher was now left undisturbed, so far as regarded the Ottomans; but his restless character involved him in disputes with his tincle and his brother. More than one affray between them took place, from which Daher came off conqueror; and he at length thought it expedient to terminate these contests by putting to death the parties. Being now invested with all the power of bis family, and absolute master of his resources, ho formed new schemes of ambition. The commerce which he had carried on, made him sensible of the advantage of a direct communication with the sea, and he fixed his eyes on Acre as a port exactly suitable to his purpose. It was at that time only a miserable village, in the midst of ruins, open and defenceless. The Pasha of Sidon kept up the show of authority there by means of an aga and a few soldiers, but the whole of the adjacent territory was־ subject to the Bedouins. A pretext only was wanting, and this was soon afforded by the conduct of the Aga. One day, having obtained intelligence that military stores, destined to be employed against him, had been landed there, the Sheikh marched suddenly towards Acre, despatched to the Aga a threatening letter, which made him take to flight, and obtained possession of the place without striking a blow. This took place about the year 1749. Sheikh Daher was then near sixty-three years of age ; but, more than twenty-five years after, he retained vigour sufficient to manage a spirited charger. This bold stroke entailed consequences which he did not fail to anticipate and provide against. He wrote immediately to the Pasha of Sidon, representing that what had taken place between him and the Aga was merely a personal affair, and that he was as much as ever the loyal subject of the Sultan and the Pasha; that he would pay tribute for the districts he had taken possession of, as the Aga had done; and he engaged, moreover, to keep in order the Arabs, and to do all in his power to improve the condition of the country. His memorial, supported by a few thousand sequins, had its effect in the divarf of Sidon and of Constantinople: they admitted the force of his arguments, and conceded all that he desired. Not that the Porte was the dupe of his protestations ; but it is its economical policy to temporise with its rebellious vassals, and, so long as appearances are kept up by their outward homage, to accept of what it can obtain in the shape of tribute, and patiently await the turn in the tide of events, that, sooner or later, is sure to rid the country of the petty despot; in which case, the Sultan never fails to have the largest share of the spoil."/>

Under pretence of building for himself a house, he began, by constructing a palace, which he fortified. Then, to protect the port, he built some towers on the coast; and, at length, enclosed the whole town, on the landside, with a wall. All this, says Volney, passed among the Turks for wonta, although a thirty-gun frigate might have bombarded the whole coast without difficulty; and four pieces of artillery would have levelled wall and fortification presently. But, where ignorance is common to both assailants and the assailed, the chances are equal."/>

The husbandman might now sow, without seeing his crops destroyed by cavalry; might reap, without seeing his harvest carried away by banditti. The fertility of the soil was a powerful attraction ; but the idea of personal security, a blessing to be estimated only by those who have lived exposed to constant alarm, operated as a still stronger inducement. It spread itself throughout Syria; and Mussulman and Christian husbandmen, every where else oppressed and despoiled, took refuge in crowds under the protection of Daher, where they found both civil and religious liberty. Even Cyprus, wasted by the exactions of its governor, by the rebellion which his oppression had occasioned, and by the atrocities of Kior Pasha,* who was sent against the insurgents, saw itself deserted by a colony of Greeks, to whom Daher gave, under the very walls of Acre, lands, which they converted into tolerable gardens. Europeans, finding here a market for their goods, soon formed establishments at Acre; and the country began to asstime a new appearance of prosperity. At the same time, Daher renewed his treaties of alliance with the chief tribes of the Desert, with the double view to provide himself a sure retreat in case of a reverse of fortune, and to employ them as a check upon the power of the Pasha of Damascus. He obtained from them also coursers of the finest breed, for which he had always a strong passion, and in exchange he furnished them with clothes and firearms. The Motoualis had for some years given disturbance to the pashas of Sidon and Damascus, by pillaging their territories and withholding their tribute. Daher stepped forward as a mediator between the parties, offering to be security for the payment of the tribute.

According to the impolitic custom of the Orientals, he had committed to his children different local governments, and had placed them at a distance from himself, in countries from which they drew their revenues. These sheikhs, considering themselves as the sons of a powerful prince, must needs maintain a state becoming their high dignity, and their expenses outran their incomes. To make up the deficiency, they had recourse to oppression ; the natives brought their complaints to Daher; he became angry, remonstrated, disputes ensued, and sometimes war broke out between the father and his children. Often brothers were at variance. The Sheikh was growing old, and his sons were looking forward to the succession ; he must appoint an heir; and contending claims to the preference became a new source of discord. Daher is accused of having favoured these dissensions through a short-sighted and sinister policy: they served to employ his soldiers, but they brought ruin on his finances, and forced him to adopt expedients ultimately prejudicial to his own interests."/>

Prince of Princes, Governor of Nazareth, Tiberias, and Saphet, and Sheikh of all Galilee.1’ Hitherto he had held his domains only from year to year, as by an annual rent. The Porte yielded every thing to the combined inducements of fear and money ; but this step, whether dictated by vanity or by policy on the part of the Sheikh, served to provoke the jealousy and animosity of the Divan, which had, besides, serious grounds of complaint against him, and to nourish an unextinguishable desire of vengeance. Among other causes for this dissatisfaction, the pillage of the caravan to Mecca, in 1757, by his Arab allies, was not to be forgiven. Sixty thousand pilgrims spoiled and dispersed through the Desert, a great number of whom were destroyed by the sword, or perished by hunger,—women carried into captivity as slaves,—the immense booty which fell into the hands of the robbers,—above all, the sacrilegions nature of the outrage, produced throughout the empire an unexampled sensation. Daher had suffered the Arabs to dispose of their booty at Acre ; this drew down on him the bitterest remonstrances of the Porte, and he found it no easy task to exculpate himself. At another time it was found out that; the Maltese corsairs, who had for some years infested the coast, were suffered to lie off Acre under the disguise of a neutral flag, and to dispose in that port of prizes taken from the Turks. The Moslems cried out sacrilege; the Porte thundered forth its threats; on which Daher, protesting his ignorance, fitted out two galiots for the feigned purpose of chastising or capturing the corsairs, but really with a view to carry on the communication by sea, out of the sight of witnesses. He did more : he pretended that the roads of Caipha were unprotected, that the enemy could land there in spite of him, and lie required the Porte to build a forte there at the expense of the Turkish government. It was done, and some time after, Daher made it appear that the fort was of no use; he razed it, and transported the brass cannon to Acre."/>

He had been with this view appointed to the pashalic in 1760, and, to increase his influence, his two sons were nominated the Pashas of Tripoli and Sidon.

This sort of proceeding is not unusnal in Turkey, but, pushed to so unbearable an extreme, it excited universal murmurs, and Palestine wanted only a foreign protector, to follow the example of Egypt, then in revolt against the Sultan."/>

Having there effected a junction with 1200 Motoualis commanded by Sheikh Nassif, and 1500 Szaffadians (as Daher’s people were called), commanded by Ali the son of Daher, they marched, in April, on Damascus. Osman, having had time to prepare for their reception, had assembled on his part an army not less numerous and not better disciplined : he had been joined by the Pashas of Sidon, Tripoli, and Aleppo, and they aAvaited the enemy under the very Avails of Damascus. The 6th of June is given as the date of the decisive encounter. The Maraa19uks and the Szaffadians rushed with such fury on the Turks, that the latter, terrified with the carnage, took to flight; the Pashas were not the last to save themselves, and the allies, left masters of the field, obtained possession, without resistance, of the town, the castle only excepted. That capitulated on the third day, and the place was to have been surrendered on the morrow, when the break of day brought with it the strangest of revolutions. At the moment that they were expecting the signal for its being given up, Mahommed all at once sounded a retreat, and every Mamalouk turned his face towards Egypt. In vain Ali Daher and Nassif in astonishment demanded the reason of this unaccountable movement. The Mamalouk chief deigned no other answer than a haughty menace, and all decamped in confusion. It was not a retreat, but a flight: one would have thought that the enemy was at their heels. The route from Damascus to Cairo was covered with baggage,, ammunition, and other traces of the fugitives. This strange adventure was, at the time, attributed to a false report of the death of Ali Bey; but the true solution of the enigma was, a secret conference held during the night in the tent of Mohammed Bey. Osman, finding that he could not prevail by force of arms, had recourse to the arts of seduction, and succeeded in inspiring the Egyptian general with jealousy of his own master, Ali Bey, so as to make him and his Beys resolve on their instantaneous return."/>

A considerable number, in attempting to escape, perished in the waters and marshes of the lake; and it was thought that the Pasha himself had shared this fate; but he had the good fortune to escape, borne on the shoulders of two black slaves, who swam across. While these events were taking place, the Pasha of Sidon, Darouich, son of Osman, had engaged the Druses in his cause, and five hundred akkals, headed by Ali Djonbalat, had arrived to support him, while the Emir Yousef, with 25,000 men, had descended into the Valley of the Motoualis, where he laid every thing waste with fire and sword.

The old Sheikh, now in his eightyfifth or eighty-sixth year, was not indisposed to close with the proposals which held out the prospect of his closing his days in peace; but his minister Ibrahim, a man of insatiable avarice, instigated by his own private motives, dissuaded him. He calculated that, the next spring, AH Bey would return as the conqueror of Syria; instead of which, the rebellion of Mahommed Bey against his patron, in the February of the following year, terminated in Ali’s arriving* at Acre as a fugitive and a suppliant, with only eight hundred Mamalouks. Their passage was opposed by the Turkish faction in Jaffa, who took advantage of this reverse in the fortunes of Daher, to regain the ascendancy, aided by the Sheikh of Nablous. At the same time, a large army of Turks, which had assembled near Aleppo, was announced to be approaching. But Daher, undaunted, first marched towards Nablous, chastising the rebels as he passed, and having joined Ali Bey below Jaffa, returned with him to Acre, whence he prepared to take the field against the Turks. In the roads of Caipha were some Bussian vessels, which were taking in provisions ; with these the Sheikh negociated, and, for a present of six hundred purses, engaged them to second his operations by sea. His army at this time is said to have consisted of 5 or 6000 Szaffadian and Motouali cavalry, exclusive of Ali’s Mamalouks, and about 1000 Mogrebin infantry. The Turks, united with the Druses, amounted to 10,000 cavalry and 20,000 peasants. They were besieging Sidon, when Daher’s approach led them to retreat to the north of the town, there to await his attack. Volney describes the position of the two armies with the minuteness of an eyewitness. The Turkish army, extending from the sea to the foot of the mountains, was drawn up in platoons nearly in the same line. The akkals, on foot, were posted on the sea-shore behind some hedges of nopals, and in trenches, while the cavalry occupied the plain. Towards the centre, and a little in advance, were eight pieces of cannon, twelve and twentyfour pounders ; the only artillery hitherto made use of in the open field. At the foot of the mountains, and on their declivity, was arrayed the militia of the Druses, armed with muskets, unprotected by either intrenchments or artillery. Daher formed his little army so as to present the greatest front possible. His right wing, commanded by Nassif, consisted of the Motoualis and the Mogrebin infantry, intended to oppose the peasant Druses. The left, led on by Ali Daher, was designed to act in concert with the Russians. In the centre were the 800 Mamalouks. The action was begun by the Russian vessels, and no sooner had they fired a few broadsides, than the akkals retreated in confusion. The Mamalouks immediately gallopped full speed on the enemy, and the gunners, intimidated, fired their pieces with precipitation, and took to flight. The volley did but little execution, and the Mamalouks now rushed upon the Turkish cavalry, who made a feeble resistance. In the confusion which ensued, the Pashas first set the example of flight. The Druses, who never engage with good-will on the side of the Turks, retreated to their mountains, and in less than an hour the plain was cleared. The allies would not risk a pursuit; but the Russians, to punish the Druses, proceeded to cannonade Beirout, and made a descent on the coast, where they burned 300 houses."/>

Having placed a governor here for Daher, Ali Bey returned to Acre, where the Sheikh had been occupied with preparations to enable his ally to return to Egypt. They waited only for a succour of 600 men promised by the Russians j but the rash impatience of Ali Bey determined him to depart without them. Daher in vain endeavoured to detain him, but, finding his resolution fixed, he sent 1500 cavalry to accompany him, commanded by Osman, one of his sons. Not many days after, in April 1773, the Russians arrived with the reinforcement; and the regret which this circumstance occasioned the old Sheikh, was severely aggravated when his son arrived at the head of his fugitive troops, to announce the defeat and death of Ali Bey. This event was the more disastrous, as, in the place of a powerful ally, he had acquired in Mahommed an active and implacable enemy. A fortunate circumstance, however, at this juncture, contributed to console his mind and divert his attention. The Emir of the Druses, thwarted by a powerful faction, had been compelled to solicit the assistance of the Pasha of Damascus, to maintain himself in possession of Beirout. The Pasha had in consequence sent there Achmed-el-Djezzar, afterwards so notorious as Pasha of Acre. No sooner was this man invested with the command of the town, than he determined to seize it for himself. He began by converting to his own use 50,000 piastres belonging to the Kmir Yousef, and openly declared that he acknowledged no master but the Sultan. The Emir, astonished at this perfidy, in vain demanded justice of the Pasha of Damascus. Djezzar was disavowed, but not ordered to restore the town. Piqued at this refusal, the Emir complied with the general wish of the Druses, and contracted an alliance with Daher. • The treaty was concluded at Ras-el-Ain, near Tyre, and the Sheikh immediately proceeded with his new allies to reduce the rebel. The Russian ships, which had not quitted the coast, readily engaged, for a second sum of 6*oo purses, to cannonade Beirout, while the attack was made on the land side by Daher and the Druses. Djezzar, after a vigorous resistance, was obliged to capitulate ; he surrendered himself to Daher, who, charmed with his courage, and flattered with the mark of confidence he had given in the surrender, conducted him to Acre, and shewed him every mark of kindness. He even ventured to trust him with a small expedition into Palestine ; but Djezzar, on appreaching Jerusalem, went over to the Turks, and returned to Damascus."/>

The sons of the Sheikh, who saw their real or supposed privileges invaded by these encroachments, loudly complained of the grievance ; and Daher, whose judgment was perhaps impaired by his extreme old age, did not adopt measures adapted to appease their discontent. He called his children rebels, and imagined that he had no faithful servant but Ibrahim. The death of Ali Bey, however, had led this crafty minister to abate somewhat of his haughtiness, and to change his line of policy. Finding that he had now more to fear than to hope for, he resolved to make terms with the Porte ; and for this purpose, in 1774, he concluded a treaty with a capidji whom the Porte maintained at Acre, by Avhich it was agreed, that Daher and his sons should retain the government of the country, but that Sidou should be restored, and the Sheikh pay the miri as formerly. These conditions were extremely unsatisfactory to the sons of Daher, and the more so, because they were agreed on without their being parties to the treaty.

On his evacuating the town, for want of effective succour, the Capudan-pasha instantly appeared before Acre. At the sight of the enemy, a consultation was held how to escape the danger. Ibrahim was for repelling force by force; Denyizla advised having recourse to the safer expedient of corruption, pledging himself that the Pasha might be turned into a friend by a present of 2000 purses. The avarice of Ibrahim led him to oppose this suggestion; he protested that it 'was impossible to raise such a sum, and the infatuated old Sheikh took the part of his minister. A quarrel ensued. Denyizla, enraged, after reproaching Ibrahim with his extortion, oppression, and falsehood, quitted the council, and immediately gave directions to his countrymen, who composed the chief strength of the place, not to lire upon the enemy. Daher, however, made every preparation for withstanding the attack. On the following day, Ilassan began the cannonade, and Daher answered with the few pieces near him ; but, in spite of his reiterated orders, the others did not fire.

Djezzar was the first governor who laid a tax on wine, grain, and other articles of consumption j and his monopoly was fatal alike to agriculture and to commeixe. The magnificence of his public works ill compensated for the destructive and ruinous effects of his oppression, which were visible in the changed aspect of the country. Till the year 1791, the French had factories at Acre, Sidon, and Beirout ; but, about that time, a French dragoman, having in some way offended the Pasha, was, by his order, summarily strangled. The French remonstrated, and threatened Djezzar with an application to the Porte. This he only laughed at: but, to punish what he termed the insolence of the Franks, he issued a mandate, expelling all the French from his territories, allowing them only three days to abandon their respective establishments, under pain of death. In Iל97ל be conceded permission for French merchants to settle under his government on the footing of those of any other nation, but peremptorily refused to acknowledge any French consul, or to make any compensation for the losses sustained by the factory. When the French invaded Syria, Djezzar declared himself the ally of the English ; but he afterwards accused Sir Sidney Smith of having fomented dissensions in his dominions, to divert him from the possibility of assisting the French. “ I wished,” he said, “ to combat the French by his side, but he has taken care that I shall be confined at home to fight against my own people. Have I merited such treatment ? ” Twice he sent a supply of cattle for the use of the English fleet, for which he required no remuneration, except a few pieces of artillery, or a little ammunition. It is said that no payment of any kind was ever made to him. His power at last became even more formidable to the Porte than that of Shiekh Daher had been. He enjoyed, with the title of vizier, the united pashalics of Acre, Gaza, Tripoli, and Damascus ; so that he was, in fact, absolute master of almost the whole of Syria. There remained only the pashalic of Aleppo for the completion of his desires ; and this he probably would have attained, had he lived but a few years longer. By means of his spies, and the judicious distribution of his money, at the Ottoman court, he contrived to baffle all the machinations of his enemies, and had the rare good fortune to die at last a natural death. Some short time before his decease, conscious that his end was approaching, he sent for his father-in-law,*Shiekh Taha, to consult him as to what he should do. with the rascals in his prisons. u The greater part of them,&quot; he said, “ are governors, who, if they return to their posts, will be forced to ruin a great many poor people in order to replace the wealth which I have taken from them; so that it is best, both for their own sakes and for that of others, that I should destroy them. Yes, yes, that is best. Despatch them.” In obedience to this humane decision, twenty-three persons are said to have been added to the long list of the victims of his cruelty; they were thrown into the sea together. Two among his prisoners, however, were excepted ; one by design, the other, it is supposed, by accident. He held in confinement at Caipha the celebrated Nassif Pasha, a man of considerable abilities, courage., and liberality, and of an ancient Syrian family; who, when the French marched out of Cairo to attack the Grandvizier, took possession of the city, and gallantly defended it against General Kleber for thirty-four days, at the end of which he made an honourable capitulation. This Pasha, finding himself ungratefully neglected by the Porte, had thrown himself into the arms of Djezzar, who, either out of jealousy or for some unknown reason, after beguiling him with the promise of the government of Damascus, had him arrested and thrown into prison. It is supposed that Djezzar had no intention of leaving him behind, but that his own death took place before he found it convenient to put his intention into execution, on which Nassif escaped, and retired to Damascus. The other more fortunate survivor, was Ismael, Pasha of Marash, Avho had also fled to Djezzar for protection from the persecution of the Grand-vizier, but had subsequently lost his favour. Djezzar, having no children, fixed upon this individual as a man likely to inherit his own rancorous hatred of the Grandvizier, and his own spirit of independence, and he determined on making him the heir of his wealth also, as well as of his government. Accordingly, he sent for him a short time before his death ; and Ismael, who expected only to hear the sentence of death passed upon him by the tyrant, must have been beyond measure astonished to hear Djezzar declare him his successor. “ There,,י said he, u I leave you plenty of troops, plenty of money to pay them, and good fortifications to fight in ; if you are a man, you will keep them, and my enemies will have no reason to exult in my death.&quot; This modern Herod, after an illness of nine months, originating in a tertian fever, expired May 71804 י, in the seventyfifth year of his age, and the thirtieth of his pashalie of Sidon."/>

Pococke mentions a village on the hills, near the sea, called Adnou ; and, beyond this, a village lying on the east of the route, called Serphant, which he supposes to be a corruption of Sarepta. “There are,” he says, “ great marks of improvements about the hills; and at the foot of them are a great number of sepulchral grots cut into the rock. It is said, that the house of the widow who received Elias, and was so miraculously supplied during his stay with her, was by the sea-side, where there now stands a small mosque, into which I entered. There is a little cell in it, where they say the prophet lay. The old Sarepta was most probably here, for I saw several foundations of walls, and those sepulchres must have belonged to the people of this town. About a quarter of a mile north of the mosque are some ruins of a very ancient building, as I conjectured it to.be, from a round plinth which projected about a foot beyond the pillar, and the edges of it were taken off; the whole being exactly after the manner of the very ancient architecture which I saw in Egypt.” Manndrell indulges the same conjecture, that the principal part of the city stood below, in the space between the hills and the sea, where the ruins are to be seen to a considerable extent. The place shewn him for Sarepta, consisted of “ only a few houses on the tops of the mountains, within about half a mile of the sea:יי it was called Sarphar, and is plainly the same place that Pococke refers to. There can be little doubt that this is the ancient Sarepta: the question is, whether the city extended to the coast. The mosque is, no doubt, the successor to some more ancient structure, and is likely to occupy the place of the church built over what was shewn as the prophet’s cell in the time of Jerome. That is said to have been in the midst of the city. On the other hand, the sepulchral grots must have been without the city; and the preservation of the name would lead us to suppose that it occupied the summit of the hill, agreeably to the usual situation of the Syrian cities. Sarepta was not celebrated as a maritime city, but for the excellence of its wines;* and its vineyards, no doubt, clothed the slope of the hill on which the modern village stands. No stress can be laid on the silly legend attaching to the mosque. There was probably some old tower which the Empress Helena chose to consecrate to the prophet’s memory; and the church, with the modern town, sprang up afterwards.

This, however, is probably meant to apply to the Phenicians generally, rather than specifically to the Sidonians. Sidon has generally shared in the fortunes of Tyre, as to its political condition ; but its prosperity has risen and fallen almost in an inverse ratio to that of its rival. During the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem, Sidon was a lordship, and an episcopal see subject to the Tyrian primacy. Louis IX. repaired the city, which appears at that time to have sunk into neglect. When Tyre subsequently became ruined and deserted, Sidon rose into the dignity of a distinct capital, the residence of a pasha of three tails. In the middle of the last century, when Hasselquist found at Tyre only about ten inhabitants, Turks and Christians, who lived by fishing, Sidon was a place of considerable trade; and now it seems as if Acre and Tyre were likely again to absorb, the one its political honours,"/>

On reaching the summit, we saw below us on the other side, the tidhr-el- K 676, or river of the dog, running beautifully through a deep chasm in the mountains, and a very neat bridge over it.” This road is the Via Antoniniana, and was cut by the Emperor Aurelius, as is still testified by an inscription engraved in the side of the rock, and given by Maundrell. uln passing this way,,י lie says, “we observed, in the sides of the rock above us, several tables of figures carved, which seemed to promise something of antiquity; to be satislied of which, some of us clambered up to the place, and found there some signs as if the old way had gone into that region, before Antoninus cut the other more convenient passage a little lower. In several places hereabouts, we saw strange antique figures of men, carved in the natural rock, in mezzo-relievo, the size of life. Close by each figure was a large table, planed in the side of the rock, and bordered round with mouldings. Both the effigies and the table appear to have been anciently inscribed all over; but the characters are now so defaced, that nothing but the footsteps of them were visible ; only there was one of the figures that had both its lineaments and its inscriptions entire. The figures seemed to resemble mummtes, and were, perhaps, the representation of some persons buried hereabout, whose sepulchres might probably also be discovered by the diligent observer.” This accurate traveller expresses his regret at having־ been prevented by a very violent storm from copying the inscription. Pococke states, that one of the figures has a cap like the Phrygian bonnet, and he conjectures that the costume is Persian. The nahr~el- Kdb is the Lycus of the Greeks. According to Strabo, it was formerly navigable, though the stream is very rapid. It is said to derive its name from 44 an idol in the form of a dog or wolf, which was worshipped, and is said to have pronounced oracles, at this place. The image,” adds Maundrell, 44 is pretended to be shewn to strangers at this day lying in the sea with’its heels upwards ; I mean the body of it, for its oracular head is reported to have been broken off and carried to Venice, where (if fame be true) it may be seen at this day,” Pococke was shewn this 44 large stone,יי which is supposed to be the trunk of the idol, lying in the sea, at the mouth of the river; and, on one side of the road, he noticed 44 a ruin something like the pedestal of a statue.” There is also a relief on the rock over the river at the end of the bridge, which, though much defaced, seems to have represented a dog. The bridge is the work of Fakr-el-Din. This river is the boundary of the patriarchates of Jerusalem and Antioch; and Volney makes it the modern limit of the pashaiics of Saide and Tripoli. Maundrell, however, speaks of an old stone bridge, two hours and a quarter further, at the end of a large bay, which he calls Junta, as appointing the limits of the two pashaiics. The Castravan mountains, which are very high and steep, here come down to the sea, leaving only the road between them and the bay. At the foot of the promontory which forms the southern extremity of this bay, are the remains of a chapel cut out of the rock, said to be the sepulchre of St. George. Above it is a cottage in which live some poor fishermen. Towards the further side, is another of those square towers which are found all along the coast, and are supposed to have been designed to protect the country against pirates. On the summits of the mountains are seen many small convents, romantically situated. The valley at the end of this hay is cultivated and studded with cottages. Proceeding along the beach, Captain Mangles noticed a Roman arch, constructed of large stones, over a dry torrent: this is, seemingly, the old stone bridge Maundrell alludes to. Beyond this is a very rugged, uneven pass, which leads over the foot of 44 the mountain Climax,&quot; and, in an hour and a quarter further, to the nahr-Ibrahim, so called from a pasha of that name—perhaps the builder of the handsome bridge of one arch by which it is crossed. This river, like the nahr-el-Kelb, proceeds from a deep chasm between the mountains : it is the ancient Adonis, and Maundrell wfas fortunate enough 44 to see what may be supposed to be the occasion of that opinion which Lucian relates concerning this river, viz., that this stream, at certain seasons of the year, especially about the feast of Adonis, is of a bloody colour; which the heathens looked upon as proceeding from a kind of sympathy in the river for the death of Adonis, who was killed by a wild boar in the mountains out of which this stream rises. Something like this we saw actually come to pass; for the water was stained to a surprising redness, and, as we observed in travelling, had discoloured the sea a great way in, to a reddish hue ; occasioned, doubtless, by a sort of red earth washed into the river by the violence of the rain.” The night preceding had been very tempestuous, and the rain almost incessant."/>

Rightly understood, however, the dispute related only to the question of power; the Mussulmans, though divided as to the conflicting claims of the rival representatives of the Prophet, still being agreed as to dogmas. It was not till the century following, that the perusal of Greek books excited among the Arabians a spirit of discussion and controversy, hitherto foreign to their ignorance. The effects were such as might have been expected : reasoning upon matters that did not admit of demonstration, and guiding their inquiries by the principles of an unintelligible logic, they became divided into a crowd of opinions and sects. At the same time, the civil power fell into a state of anarchy, and the ecclesiastical government shared its fate. ' Thus was the unity of the Mahommedan church destroyed, and various corruptions in consequence made their appearance. The ancient doctrines of metempsychosis, or transmigrations, of a good and an evil principle, and other tenets held by the disciples of Zoroaster, were revived, among others; and in the general disorder, political and religious, which ensued, no fewer than sixty different heresiarchs are said to have arisen, all having numerous partisans. Such was the state of things, when, at the commencement of the eleventh century, Egypt became the theatre of one of the most fantastic spectacles which history exhibits. 44 In the year 38G of the Hegira,” (A.D. 9G6,) says El Makin, the Arabian historian, 44 there acceded to the throne of Egypt, at the age of eleven, the third Caliph of the Patimite dynasty, named Hakim-b’amr-Allah. This prince was one of the most eccentric personages of whom the memory of man has preserved any recollection. First, he decreed curses to be pronounced in the mosques against the first caliphs, the companions of Mahommed; then he revoked these anathemas. At one time he compelled both Jews and Christians to abjure their religion; then he allowed them to resume their worship. He prohibited the making of socks (chaussures) for women, to prevent their leaving their'houses. In order to amuse himself, he had one half of Cairo set on fire, while his soldiers pillaged the other half. Not content with these excesses, he proceeded to interdict pilgrimage to Mecca, fasting, and the five prayers; at length, he carried his madness to the extreme of wishing to pass himself off for a divinity. He ordered a list to be drawn up of those gods whom he himself recognised, extending to the number of 16,000. This notion was supported by a false prophet who had recently arrived in Egypt from Persia. This impostor, whose name was Mahommed• Ben-Ismael, taught, that it was useless to practise either fasting, prayer, circumcision, or pilgrimage, or to observe the sacred days; that the prohibition of pork and wine was absurd ; and that incestuous marriages were lawful. In order to conciliate the favour of Hakim, he maintained that this caliph was himself an incarnation of the Deity ; and instead of his name Hakim-Vamr-Allah, which signifies governor by the order of God, he called him Hakim-b,amr-eh, governor by his own order. Unhappily for the prophet, his new god had not power to secure him against the fury of his enemies : they killed him in a tumult at the very feet of the caliph, who soon after was massacred on Mount Mokattam, where he professed to hold intercourse with the angels.” The death of these two leaders did not put a stop to the spread of their opinions. A disciple of Mahommed-Ben-Ismael, named Hamza-Ben-Achmed, propagated them with indefatigable zeal in Egypt, in Palestine, and on the coast of Syria as high as Sidon and Berytus. His proselytes appear to have experienced the same fate as the Maronites : persecuted by those of the dominant persuasion, they took refuge in the mountains of Lebanon, where they could better defend themselves. Thus much is certain, that soon after this epoch, we find them established and forming an independent community, like their Christian neighbours. The difference of their religions might have been expected to render them enemies; but their common political dangers and interests compelled them to mutual toleration; and since then, they have almost always acted in concert, at one time against the Crusaders, or the Sultans of Aleppo, at another, against the Maraalouks and the Ottomans. The conquest of Syria, by the latter, made no change in their political condition. Selim 1., who, on his return from Egypt, meditated no less an enterprise than the conquest of Europe, did not condescend to stop before the mountains of Libanus. Sulieman 11., his successor, was too incessantly occupied with important wars, at one time against the knights of Rhodes, the Persians, and the Arabians, at another time, against the Hungarians and Charles the Fifth, to have time to think of the Druses. These contests made them grow bolder; and, not content with their independence, they made frequent descents from their mountains to pillage the subjects of the Turk. The pashas in vain attempted to restrain these incursions : their troops were uniformly beaten or repulsed. It was not till the year 1588, that Amurath 111., wearied with the incessant complaints which reached his ears, resolved on reducing these rebels at any cost, and had the good fortune to succeed. His general, Ibrahim Pasha, attacked the Druses and the Maronites with so much skill and vigour, that he at length fell upon them in their mountains, and taking advantage of dissensions which arose among their chiefs, succeeded in levying a contribution of more than a million of piastres, and in imposing a tribute which has continued to be paid to the present day."/>

On being appointed governor of the Druses, he began with endeavouring to gain the confidence of the Porte by the warmest professions of devotedness and fidelity. The Arabs were infesting the plain of Balbec, and the neighbourhood of Tyre and Acre; he made war against them, delivered the inhabitants from their incursions, and thus prepared their minds to acquiesce in his government. The city of Beii’out offered a desirable point of communication with foreign nations, in particular with the Venetians, the natural enemies of the Turks. Fakr-el־Din availed himself of the misconduct of the aga, and expelled him. He did more : he knew how to make a merit of this act of hostility with the Divan, by the payment of a larger tribute. He took the same course with regard to Sidon, Balbec, and Tyre ; and at length, in IGI3, found himself master of the country as far as Ajalon and Saphet. The pashas of Damascus and Tripoli did not witness these encroachments without uneasiness. Sometimes they opposed them by open force, but without being able to stop the course of Fakr-el-Din : at other times they attempted to ruin him at the Porte by secret intrigues ; but the Emir, who had also there in pay his spies and protectors, always contrived to baffle them. The Divan, however, at last took alarm at the progress of the Druses, and began to fit out an expedition of sufficient force to crush them. Either from policy or through fear, Fakr-el-Din did not think propei־ to await the storm. He had entered into alliances with Italy, on which he built the most sanguine expectations ; and he resolved to go in person to solicit the promised succour, persuaded that his presence would animate the zeal of his friends, while his absence would tend to allay the wrath of his enemies. In consequence of this determination, which shewed no ordinary decision and enterprise in a barbarian, he embarked at Beirout, having committed the management of all his affairs to his son Ali, and repaired to the court of the Medici at Florence. The arrival of an Oriental prince in Italy did not fail to attract public attention. The question arose, to what nation he belonged; and when he was known to be a prince of the Druses, the origin of that people became a subject of inquiry. The facts of their history, as well as the character of their religion, were found so equivocal, that persons were at a loss whether to make Mussulmans of them, or Christians. This revived the recollection of the Crusades, and it was imagined, that a people who had taken shelter in the mountains, and were inimical to the natives, must needs be the posterity of the Croises. This hypothesis was too favourable to Fakr-el-Diu’s project, for him to throw discredit on it: he had, on the contrary, the address to lay claim to certain pretended alliances with the house of Lorraine ; and he was seconded by the missionaries and the merchants, who promised themselves a new sphere for conversions and commerce. While this opinion was all the vogue, every one was for finding proofs to establish this romantic discovery. Some persons, learned in origins, struck with the resemblance between the names, contended that the Druses and Dreux were the same; and they reared on this slender foundation the hvpothesis of an imaginary colony of French crusaders who, under their leader, a Count de Dreux, had established themselves in Libanus. This pretty invention was annihilated by the discovery, that Benjamin of Tudela mentions the Druses before the time of the Crusades. But one fact which ought to have led to its being exploded when first started, is, that the dialect spoken by the Druses is pure Arabic, and does not contain a word of European origin. Had they been descended from the Franks, they would have preserved at least some traces of their language ; since a community living in a separate canton, and isolated from their neighbours, never can lose its native dialect. The true etymology of their name is to be found in the surname of El Dorzi, or Durzi, assumed by Mahommed Ben Ismael, the founder of their sect."/>

During his absence, his son Ali had repulsed the Turks, restored tranquillity, and kept things in tolerable order. Nothing remained for the Emir to do, but to employ the knowledge he had acquired, in perfecting the internal administration, and promoting the welfare of his nation. But, instead of turning his mind to the serious duties of government, he gave himself up entirely to the frivolous and expensive arts for which he had acquired a passion in Italy. He built in every direction country-houses ; he constructed baths and gardens; he ventured even, in open disregard of the national prejudices, to adorn them with paintings and sepulchres, which are forbidden by the Koran. It was not long before the effects of this impolitic conduct became manifest. The Druses, who continued to furnish the same tribute as in time of war, became dissatisfied. The Yemeny faction began to stir; the expensive proceedings of the Prince were loudly complained of, while the pomp which he displayed, rekindled the jealousy of the pashas. They demanded an augmentation of the contributions, and hostilities recommenced. Fakr-el-Din repulsed them, and they took advantage of his resistance, to render him an object of suspicion and personal jealousy to the Sultan. Amurath IV. took offence that one of his subjects should dare vie with himself, and he determined on his destruction. The Pasha of Damascus received orders, in consequence, to march against Beirout, the Emir,s ordinary residence, while forty galleys invested the city by sea, to cut off all succour from that quarter. Fakr-el-Din, relying on his former good fortune and his Italian allies, resolved upon meeting the storm. His son Ali, the governor of Szaffad, was charged with stopping the progress of the Turkish army, and, notwithstanding a great disproportion of numbers, he ventured to oppose them. In two successive engagements he had the advantage; but, in a third, he was slain, and the aspect of affairs became instantly changed. Fakr-el-Din, dismayed at the loss of his troops, distressed by the death of his son, and weakened as well by age as by a voluptuous life, lost at once both courage and presence of mind. He saw no other resource but a peace, and he sent his second son on board the vessel of the Turkish admiral, to solicit it, and to bribe his good offices in the negotiation ; but the admiral, detaining both the presents and the envoy, declared that he required the person of the Prince. On this, Fakr-el-Din took to flight, pursued by the Turks, now masters of the country, and shut himself up in the rocky fortress of Niha. Here they besieged him ; but, after a year had passed in the fruitless attempt to take the place, they retired, leaving him at liberty. Soon after, however, the companions of his adversity, tired of their disgrace, betrayed him to the Turks. Fakr-el-Din suffered himself to be conducted to Constantinople, in the secret hope of obtaining a pardon ; and Amurath, flattered at seeing a prince so celebrated prostrate at his feet, manifested for some time the clemency inspired by a proud consciousness of superiority. But this soon gave way to the more permanent sentiment of jealousy; he lent his ear to the instigations of his courtiers, and, in a fit of his violent humour, ordered him to be strangled, about the year 1631."/>

The only emir of this dynasty who merits any record, is the Emir Melhem, who reigned from 1740 to 1759• During this interval, he succeeded in repairing the losses sustained by the Druses within, and in ohtaining for them from without that consideration from which they had fallen on the overthrow of Fakr-el-Din. Towards the close of his life, that is to say, about 1754, disgusted with the cares of government, Melhem abdicated, with the intention of spending the rest of his days in retirement and religious meditation as an akkal. But the disorders which arose, recalled him to the charge of public affairs till 1751), when he died generally lamented. He left three sons, all under age. The eldest, Yousef, ought, according to custom, to have succeeded his father; but, as he was only eleven years of age, the government devolved on his uncle Mansour, by a pretty general law in Asia, which provides that nations shall be governed by a man having attained years of discretion. The young prince was but incompetent to maintain his pretensions; but a Maronite named Said-el-Koufi, to whom Melhem had confided his education, took upon himself this cave. Aspiring to see his pupil a powerful prince, that he might himself become a powerful vizier, he laboured with all his might to advance his fortunes. In the first instance, he retired with him to Djebail, in the Kesrouan, where the Emir Yousef possessed large domains. Here he made it his business to ingratiate himself with the Maronites, by seizing every opportunity of serving both individuals and the nation. The large revenues of his pupil and the smallness of his expenditure, furnished him with powerful resources. The domain of the Kesrouan was divided among several sheikhs, who gave little satisfaction : Said negotiated with the Pasha of Tripoli, and got into his hands the whole management.

While the Druses, elated with this exploit, were marching in disorder on the latter town, 500 Motoualies, having received information of what had taken place, hastened from Acre in a transport of rage and despair, and rushed with such impetuosity on this army, that they put it completely to rout. Such Avere the surprise and confusion of the Druses, that, imagining themselves to he attacked by Daher himself, and seized with the idea that they must have been betrayed by a party of their own, they turned their arms against each other in their flight. The steep declivities of Djezzin, and the pinegroves which lay in the route of the fugitives, were choked up with the dead, a very small proportion of whom perished by the hands of the Motoualies. The Emir Yousef, ashamed of this disgraceful check, saved himself at Deir-el־Kamar. Shortly after, he would have retrieved his fortunes, but, being again beaten in the plain which extends between Sidon and Tyre, he was compelled to resign to his uncle Mansour the ring, which is, among the Druses, the symbol of authority."/>

It Avas then that, to secure Beirout against the adverse faction, he invoked the aid of the Turks, and solicited the Pasha of Damascus to send him a man of talent, Avho should be able to defend the town. The sequel has been already given. The individual fixed on for this purpose was the notorious Achmed, afterwards known by his assumed surname, Djezzar, or the butcher. Iv/o sooner was he in possession of his trust, than he seized the town on his own account. Yousef, unable to obtain redress, concluded the alliance, offensive and defensive, with Sheikh Daher, which led to his regaining possession of Beirout. The death of Daher, and the appointment of Djezzar in his room, placed Yousef in the unpleasant predicament of being subordinated to this formidable enemy, whose resentment was so much the keener for the consciousness of having been guilty of ingratitude to the object of it. The injure!• never forgives. With a policy truly Turkish, affecting by turns gratitude and resentment, Djezzar alternately quarrelled with the Emir and became reconciled to him ; always exacting money as the price of peace, or as the indemnification of war, till, within five years, he had managed to extort from Yousef about four millions sterling; an astonishing sum, especially when it is considered, that the whole revenue of the country of the Druses did not then amount to 100,000 francs. In 1784, he made war upon him, deposed him, and appointed in his room, Emir Ismael, of Hasbeia ; but, towards the end of the year, Yousef having purchased afresh the despot’s good graces, was reinstated at Deir-el-Kamar. He carried his confidence, indeed, so far as to repair to Djezzar at Acre, from which no one expected him to return. But Djezzar was too sagacious to take blood when he had the prospect of money instead. He not only suffered the prince to retain his liberty, but dismissed him with tokens of amity. Some time after, however, he seized Said, the kiaya or minister of the Emir, under the pretext that he was the originator of all these disorders, and threatened to make him forfeit his head. The Maronites, alarmed for their old patron, immediately offered to ransom him with 900 purses. “ When the country is fairly exhaasted of its gold,&quot; remarks Volney, (having hrough* down the narrative to his own time,) “ woe to botb minister and prince ! &quot;"/>

He is master of the whole mountain from Belled Akkar to near Acre, including the Valley of Bekaa and part of the Anti■' Libanus and Djebel Essheikh. The Bekaa, together with a j&gt;resent of one hundred purses, was given to him in 1810 by Sulieman, Pasha of Acre, for his assistance against Yousef, Pasha of Damascus. He pays for the possession of the whole country, 530 purses, of which 130 go to Tripoli, and 400 to Acre. This is exclusive of the extraordinary demands of the pashas, which amount to at least 300 purses more. These sums are paid as an equivalent. for the miri or land-tax, which the Emir receives. The power of the Emir, however, is a mere shadow ; the real government being in the hands of the Druse chief. Sheikh Beshir, who is the head of the powerful party of Djonbelat. After the old distinctions of Keisy and Yemeny were forgotten, it seems that there arose three sects or parties, the Djonbelat, the Yezbeky, and the Neked. These still exist. Thirty years ago, the former two were equal in power, but the Djonbelat have now got the ascendancy, and carry every thing with a high hand. This family. which is said to be ancient, derives its origin from the Druse mountain of Djehel Aala, between Latakia and Haleb (Aleppo). In the seventeenth century, one of their ancestors was pasha of the latter city. The Yezbeky, or, as they are also called, El Aemad, are few in number, but are reputed men of great courage and enterprise. Their principal residence is in the district of El Barouk, between Deir-el-Kamar and Zahle. The Neked are chiefly confined to Deir-el- Kamar. Seven of their principal chiefs were put to death thirteen years ago, in the serai of the Emir Beshir, and a few only of their children escaped the massacre : these have now attained to manhood, and are jealously watched by the united factions of Djonbelaty and Aemad. The Sheikh Beshir is both the richest and the shrewdest man in the mountain. No affair of consequence is concluded without his concurrence, which is of course not afforded without being duly paid for. His annual income is computed at about 2000 purses, or 50,000/. sterling. The whole province of Shouf is under his command, and he is in partnership with almost all the Druses who possess land and property there. The greater part of the district of Djesn is his own property; and he is increasing his estates every year. The Emir Beshir can do nothing important without his consent, and he is obliged to share with him all the contributions which he extorts from the mountaineers. The Druses, who form the richest part of the population, pay the least, being protected by the Sheikh ; and the Emir scarcely dares to do justice to a Christian against a Druse. The Emir and the Sheikh are, however, apparently, on, the best terms : the latter visits the Emir almost every week, attended by a small retinue of horsemen, and is always received with the greatest apparent cordiality.*"/>

The first propagator of these doctrines, we have seen on Arabian authority, came to Egypt from Persia ; but neither the previous history nor the nation of this adventurer is known ; only, his name is Arabian, and he appears to have been well acquainted with the Koran. He seems to have conceived the idea of patching up a new religion out of all the different systems of which he had a smattering, trusting to a mysterious jargon and a species of freemasonry, for the success of the imposture. The avaiar of the Deity in the person of the Caliph of Egypt, was the foundation stone ; and the true character of the religion, as well as of its founder, may be judged of from this single circumstance. On his part, it could not originate in fanaticism, but was obviously dictated by policy. He found in the person of the Caliph, a madman just suited to his purpose; and it is not improbable, that he intended to be his godship’s successor. This cardinal tenet is said to be sftll devoutly held, at least by the Djahels. “ They believe,” says the Rev. Mr. Connor, u that the Deity was incarnated in the person of Hakem, Caliph 0( Egypt, and that he will shortly appear again. He is to come, they think, from China, and to meet with, fight, and utterly destroy all his enemies, at a place called the Black Slone. The Druses regard the Chinese as belonging to their sect,־ and as the most exemplary members of it in the world.&quot; This prepossession in favour of China is not a little remarkable, but it can scarcely be referred to any other origin than the fantastical representations of the impostor, who, by claiming that distant nation as his votaries, might think to give importance to his pretensions : or the simple fact, when known, that the Chinese are not Mahommedans, might subsequently give rise to the notion, as well as to the idea, that there are Druses in England. Among some questions which were put to Burckhardt, in writing, by a Druse Sheikh in the Haouran, were these : u What is the name of the Sultan of China ? ” “ Is the Moehdy (the Saviour) yet come, or is he now upon the earth ? ” In the travels of Van Egmont and Heyman, a long extract is given from a book treating of the worship and mysteries of the Druses, which was communicated to the author by a capuchin of the convent of Tripoli. Although such a channel of information is not the most unexceptionable, yet, the genuineness of the document is almost proved by its inconceivable absurdity. It is stated, that, in the library of the King of France, there is an Arabic manuscript entitled, “ The Book of the Mysteries of the Unity, collected by Hamza Ben Ahmed, High Priest of the Druses,.” It consists of four volumes in quarto, of which the first three were brought to Paris by Nazarulla Ben Gilda, a Syrian physician, who procured them from one of their high-priests : the fourth was obtained from another quarter. The beginning of the extract which was communicated to Van Egmont, was so full of absurdities and obscure expressions, as to be utterly incomprehensible, and the rest is little better. It begins thus : “ All ye who alone are incorpoi’ated under the Arabic word Daraz,” &amp;c. Then follows some mystical jargon, which introduces an account of one Adam Sapha, who was born in a city of India that no one ever heard of, and a devil named Harez, originally of Ispahan. After this historical prelace, we find the names of Moses, Jesus, and Mahommed, introduced as predecessors of “ the Maoula or Ilakem, who is Mahommed the son of Ismael, and who has sealed and put an end to all other laws. And this is he (it is added) whose divinity as creator has concealed itself under the human nature of our Maoula or Hakem, speaking immediately to the creatures; and he shall shew himself in the form of a sheep.&quot; Towards the close of this strange farrago occurs this direction : “ Embrace the worship of those who have power over you ; for such is the pleasure of our Maoula, till he, to whom the best times are known, shall unsheath his sword, and display the power of his unity or simplicity.יי Upon this principle, it is certain that the Druses have constantly acted. Burckhardt says : “ It seems to be a maxim with them, to adopt the religious practices of the country in which they reside, and to profess the creed of the strongest. Hence they all profess Islamism in Syria; and even those who have Ixeen baptized on account of their alliance with the Shehab family, still practise the exterior forms of the Mahommedan faith. There is no truth in the asser* tion, that the Druses go one day to the mosque, and the next to the church. They all profess Islamism; and whenever they mix with Mahommedans, they perform the rites prescribed by their religion. In private, however, they break the fast of Ramadhan, curse Mahommed, indulge in wine, and eat food forbidden by the Koran.”*"/>

It would be a curious inquiry, what form of x־eligion the propagation of these doctx-ines displaced. There seems no reason to doubt the affinity of the Druses to the great Arabian family; but it is still possible, that there may be some truth in the notion that they are the remains or descendants of a more ancient people, and that the points of resemblance which have led to the hypothesis of their Samaritan origin, are not wholly accidental. They are evidently a mixed population, fonned by the aggregation of distinct clans, some of them refugees from distant parts. Thus, the Shehab family derive their origin from Mecca ; the Djonbelat from the mountains near Aleppo. “ The best feature in the Druse character,” says Burckhardt, “ is that peculiar law of hospitality which forbids them ever to betray a guest. I made particular inquiries on this subject, and I am satisfied, that no consideration of interest or dread of power will induce a Druse to give up a person who has once placed himself under his protection. Persons from all parts of Syria are in the constant practice of taking refuge in the mountain, where they are in perfect security from the moment they enter upon the EmiPs territory. Should the Prince ever be by large offers, to consent to give up a refugee, the whole country would rise, to prevent such a stain upon their national reputation. The mighty Djezzar, who had invested his own creatures with the government of the mountain, never could force them to give up a single indi* vidual of all those who fled thither from his tyranny. Whenever he became very urgent in his demands, the Emir informed the fugitive of his danger, and advised him to conceal himself for a time in some more distant part of his territory: an answer was then returned to Djezzar, that the object of his resentment had fled. The asylum which is thus afforded by the mountain, is one of the greatest advantages that the inhabitants of Syria enjoy over those in the other parts of the Turkish dominions.... In 1811, the Druses of Djebel Ala, between Latakia and Antioch, were driven from their habitations by Topal Ali, the governor of Djeser Shogher, whose troops committed the most horrible cruelties. Upwards of 1,500 families fled to their countrymen in the Libanus, where they were received with great hospitality.

He will overlook an insult if known only to him who h־!s offered it, and will put up with blows where his interest is concerned, provided nobody is a witness; but the slightest abuse given in public, he revenges with the greatest fury. This is the most remarkable feature of the national character. In public, a Druse may appear honourable; but he is easily tempted to a contrary behaviour when he has reason to think that his conduct will remain undiscovered. The ties of blood and friendship have no power among them : the son no sooner attains the years of maturity, than he begins to plot against his father.” This last trait is not peculiar to the Druse Arabs. Volney draws a more favourable picture, evidently with a leaning in their favour, as compared with their Christian neighbours ; whereas the information furnished by Burckhardt was pro* bably derived from the Catholics, for it could not be the result of personal observation. a The comparison,” says the French traveller, 11 which the Druses have frequent occasion to make between their lot and that of other Turkish subjects, has given them an advantageous opinion of their condition, which, by a natural process, has re-acted on their character. Exempted from the violence and insults of despotism, they look upon themselves as better men than their neighbours, because they have the good fortune to he less trampled on. Hence results a loftier, more energetic, and more active character, a true republican spirit. They are spoken of throughout the Levant, as being restless, enterprising, bold, and courageous even to rashness. They have been known to dash into Damascus in broad day, to the number of only 300, and there to spread around them confusion and carnage. It is remarkable, that, with a government almost the same as theirs, the Maronites have not these qualities in the same degree. I one day inquired the reason of this difference, in a company where the observation was made, in reference to certain recent occurrences. After a moment’s pause, an aged Maronite, taking the pipe from his mouth, and stroking his beard, replied : 4 Perhaps the Druses would fear death more, if they believed in an hereafter.’—The doctrine of forgiveness of injuries is not known among them. No people are so ready to take umbrage on a point of honour. An insult done or said to either their name or their beard, is revenged on the spot by a blow fx־om a dagger or a bullet; while, among the population of the towns, it would end only in angry words. This sensibility has produced in their manners and conversation, a reserve, or, if you will, a politeness, which one is surprised to find among a peasantry. It degenerates even into dissimulation and falsehood, especially among the chiefs, who are compelled, by their more important interests, to observe the more caution and management. Circumspection is rendered necessary in all, by the serious consequences of the lex falionis above referred to. The custom may appear to us barbarous; but it has the merit of supplying the place of regular justice, which is always uncertain and tardy in countries so often disturbed, and in a state bordering upon anarchy."/>

The nobility of the emirs and sheikhs does not exempt them from paying a tribute proportioned to their revenues, nor does it confer any prerogatives. Every one, having paid his miri and his rent, is his own master. One consequence of their prejudices is, that they seldom form alliances out of their own families. They uniformly prefer a relation, though poor, to a rich stx־anger; and common peasants have been known to refuse their daughters to merchants of Sidon and Beirout, possessed of 12 and 15,000 piasters.

Mosheim’s account of the matter is, that the doctrine of the Monothelites, (which affirmed that there was but one will in Jesus Christ,) when condemned and exploded by the general council of Constantinople, A.D. GBO, found an asylum among the Mardaites, a people inhabiting the mountains of Libanus and Antilibanus, who, about the conclusion of the seventh century, were called Maronites, after Maro their first bishop. None of the ancient writers give any account of the person who first instructed these mountaineers in the doctrine of the !Monothelites : it is probable, however, that it was John Maro, whose name they adopted, and that this ecclesiastic received his name from having lived, in the character of a monk, in the famous convent of St. Maro, upon the borders of the Orontes, before his settlement among the Mardaites of Mount Libanus. One thing is laid down as certain, from the testimony of Tvrius and ? • • other unexceptionable witnesses, viz., that the Maronites retained the opinions of the Monothelites until the twelfth century, when, abandoning and renouncing the doctrine ot one will in Christ, they were re-admitted, in the year 1182, to the communion of the Roman Church * The Maronites, however, and their writers, deny all that William of Tyre has written concerning their heresy and alleged conversion in the year 1182, charging him with having taken his whole account from Eutychius, patriarch of Alexandria in the tenth century, a man of no parts or learning. They contend that, in the time of the emperors Mauritius and Phocas, there was no such controversy about the Monothelite heresy, and that a heresiarch of the name of Maron, or Maro, is not so much as mentioned by the writers of that time. According to the Maronites themselves, (one of whom, named Faustus Nairon, published at Rome an apology for Maro and his nation,) they derive their name from the St. Maro who lived about A.D, 400, of whom mention is made by Chrysostom and Theodoret. This saintly person is said to have passed part of his time as a hermit in the desert, and his disciples are stated to have spread themselves throughout Syria, where they built several monasteries, the chief of which stood on the banks of the Orontes, near Apameia.

It appears that, in the disputes which already subsisted between Rome and Constantinople, he employ.ed his influence in favour of the Western Church. His death, far from cooling the ardour of his partisans, only gave a new impetus to their zeal. A report was spread, that miracles were wrought by virtue of his body ; and on the strength of this, crowds assembled from Kinesrin, Aouasem, and other parts, who erected to him in Hamah a chapel and a tomb. Soon afterwards, a convent sprang up here, which acquired great celebrity throughout this part of Syria. In the mean time, the disputes of the two metropolitans grew warmer, and the whole empire took part in the dissensions of prelates and princes. Things were in this state, when, towards the close of the seventh century, a monk of the convent of Hamah, named John the Maronite, succeeded, by his talents for pulpit oratory, in gaining the reputation of being one of the firmest supporters of the cause of the Latins, or partisans of the pope. Their opponents, the partisans of the emperor, on that account named Melkites, that is royalists, were at that time making great progress in Libanus. To oppose them with success, the Latins resolved to send thither John the Maronite•; and, in pursuance of this resolution, they presented him to the pope’s agent at Antioch, who, after having consecrated him bishop of !)jebail, sent him to preach in those countries. The said John was not long in rallying his partisans and augmenting their numbers ; but, thwarted by the intrigues, and even the open attacks of the Melkites, he deemed it necessary to oppose force by force : he accordingly collected together all the Latins, and established himself with them in Mount Libanus, where they formed an independent community, as to both their political and their religious constitution. The fact is noticed by an historian of the Lower Empire (Cedrenus) in the following terms: ‘ln the eighth year of Constantine Pogonat (A.D. 676), the Mardaites, having collected together, took possession of Mount Libanus, which became thenceforth the asylum of vagabonds, slaves, and all sorts of people. They became so strong as to arrest the progress of the Arabs, and to compel the Caliph Moaouia to sue for a thirty years1 truce with the Greeks, on condition of paying a tribute of fiftyrace-horses, a hundred slaves, and 10,000 pieces of gold.’"/>

It would, moreover, seem, that the origin of these two factions, and the existence of an insurrection in these countries, were anterior to the era assigned to them. For, from the earliest days of Mahommedanism, we find mention made of particular petty princes, one of whom, named Yousef, commanded at Djebail, and another, named Kesrou, governed the interior of the country, which took, from him, the name of Kesrouan. After them, ano* ther is mentioned, who engaged in an expedition against Jerusalem, and died, at an advanced age, at Beskonta, a village in the Kesrouan, where he had fixed his residence. Thus, before the time of Constantine Pogonat, these mountains had become the asylum of malcontents or rebels, who fled from the intolerance of the emperors and their agents. It was doubtless for this reason, and owing to a similarity of opinions, that John and his disciples took refuge here; and it was owing to the ascendancy which they acquired here, or which they previously possessed, that the whole nation took the name of Maronites, which was not opprobrious like that of Mardaites. However this may be, John having established among these mountaineers a regular military discipline, and furnished them alike with arms and leaders, they made use of their liberty in combating the common enemies of the empire and of their little state, and soon reudered themselves masters of almost all the mountains as far as Jerusalem. The schism which broke out among the Moslems at this period facilitated their success. Moaouia, having revolted at Damascus against Ali Caliph of Koufa, found himself compelled, in order to avoid having two wars in hand at the same time, to conclude, in 67b, a disadvantageous treaty with the Greeks. Seven years after, Abd-el-Malek renewed it with Justinian 11., on the condition, how• ever, that the Emperor should deliver him from the Maronites. Justinian had the imprudence to consent to these terms ; and he added to this the baseness rf causing their leader to be assassinated by an emissary whom this too generous man had received into his house under the auspices of peace. After this murder, the agent employed the arts of seduction and intrigue Avith such dexterity, that he led away 12,000 men from the country, thus leaving a free passage to the advance of the Mussulmans. Soon after, another persecution threatened the Maronites Avith total destruction ; for this same Justinian sent against them a body of troops under the command of Marcian and Maurice, who razed the monastery of Hamah, and massacred there 500 monks. They were proceeding to carry the Avar into Kesrouan, when happily, during these transactions, Justinian Avas deposed, on the eve of his giving orders for a general massacre in Constantinople ; and the Maronites, under the sanction of his successor, attacked Maurice, and cut his army to pieces in an engagement in which he himself perished. From this period, avc lose sight of the Maronites in histox־y, till the invasion of the Crusaders, Avith whom they were sometimes in alliance, sometimes had misunderstandings. During this interval, Avhich extended through more than three centuries, a part of their territory Avas wrested from them, and they were restricted, towards Lebanon, to certain bounds. No doubt, too, they paid tribute, Avhenever the Arab or Turcoman governors were powerful enough to exact it. They were in this state in relation to the Caliph of Fgjrpt, Hakem B’amr Allah, Avhen, about A.D. 1014, he ceded their district to the Turcoman prince of Aleppo. Two hundred years after, Selah-el-Din (Saladin) having driven the Europeans from these cantons, they found themselves compelled to bend under his yoke, and to purchase a peace by contributions. It was at this time, that is to say about A.D. 1215, that the Maronites effected a union with the Church of Home, from which they have never since been alien* ated. William of Tyre, who states the fact, says, that they had 40,000 men capable of bearing arms. Their situation was tolerably peaceful under the Mamalouks. This tranquillity was disturbed by Selim IT., but that prince, occupied with more serious cares, did not take the trouble to subjugate them. This negligence gave them confidence, and, in concert with the Druses and their emir, the celebrated Fakr-el-Din, they made daily inroads upon the Ottomans. But these movements had a disastrous issue.

This disadvantage would, no doubt, have given rise long ago to lamentable results, had they not been prevented by several fortunate circumstances. First, their religion, interposing an insurmountable barrier between the Maronites and the Mussulmans, has prevented any ambitious spirits from entering into a league with the foreigners to enslave their nation. Secondly, the nature of their country, presenting every where strong positions, furnishes every village, and almost every family, with the means of hidependent resistance, and consequently with the power of arresting the progress of a single state. We may assign as a third reason, the very feebleness of the community itself, which, having been from its origin surrounded with powerful enemies, has bpen able to withstand them only by maintaining union among its own members; and this union can be preserved, it is obvious, only so long as they abstain from oppressing one another, and reciprocally respect the personal security and property of every individual. It is thus that the government has been able to maintain itself in a natural equilibrium ; and public manners supplying the place of laws, the Maronites have been hitherto preserved alike from oppression, despotism, and the disorders of anarchy."/>

By the latter, is to be understood the more respectable of the inhabitants, who are distinguished by their ancient family, or their easy circumstances, from the peasantry. All live scattered in the mountains, by vil!ages, by hamlets, sometimes in isolated mansions, which is not the case in the plain. The whole nation are husbandmen. Each improves with his own hands the iittle domain of which he is the proprietor or occupier. Even the sheikhs follow the same mode of life, and are distinguished from the common people, only by a sorry pelisse, a horse, and some slight difference in their diet and domestic accommodations. All live frugally, without many enjoyments, but without many privations, since they are acquainted with but few objects of luxury. Generally speaking, the nation is poor, but no one is destitute of necessaries ; and if any beggars are seen there, they come from the towns on the coast. Property is as sacred as in Europe, and those spoliations and avanias are tinknown, which are so common among the Turks. You may travel night and day with a security unknown in any other part of the empire. The stranger is sure of meeting with hospitality, as among the Arabs : it is remarked, however, that the Maronites are less generous. Conformably to the principles of Christianity, they have only one wife, whom they espouse, often without having seen her, always without having been in the habit of visiting her. But, in opposition to the precepts of the Christian religion, they have admitted or preserved among them the Arab custom of the lex talionis, and the nearest relation of the person murdered is bound to avenge it. According to a practica originating in distrust and the political state of the country, every man, sheikh or peasant, always goes armed with musket and poniard. This is, perhaps, an evil, but one advantage results from it: they are not novices in the use of arms, in case of necessity, as, for instance, in defending their country against the Turks. As the country maintains no regular troops, every person is obliged to march in time of war ; and if this militia were well officered, it would be more effective than many European regiments. The number of men capable of bearing arms has been estimated, according to a recent census (1784), at 35,000, which supposes, on the usual calculation, a population of about 105,000 souls. If we add to this number the various priests, monks, and reliyieuses distributed through more than 200 convents, and further, the people of the maritime towns, such as Djebail, Batroun, &amp;c., we may safely set down the total at 115,000 souls.* This calculation, when compared with the surface of the country, which is about 150 square leagues, will give 7CO inhabitants to each square league; which is a considerable number, taking into account that a great part of Libanus is composed of rocks unsusceptible of cultivation, and that even the soil of the cultivated parts is coarse and poor.f"/>

                  <div ID="DIVL355" TYPE="TEXT" ORDER="136" LABEL="I־‘About the year 1755, there was, in the neigh bourhood of the Jesuit mission, a young Maronite damsel, named Hendia, whose extraordinary life soon attracted general attention. She fasted, wore haircloth, had the gift of tears ; it! a word, had all the exterior of the ancient hermits, and soon acquired the reputation of one. All the world looked upon her as a model of piety, and many esteemed her a saint. It was but one step more to a reputation, lor working miracles ; and, in fact, a rumour of this kind was soon spread. Hendia availed herself of this general enthusiasm to carry her ambitious designs into execution, and taking apparently for her model her predecessors in the same career, she aspired to be the foundress of a new order. To build a convent, funds were requisite. The foundress appealed to the piety of her partisans, and offerings poured in to so large an amount, that, in a few years, she was enabled to erect two large mansions built of hewn-stone, the construction of which must have cost 10,000/• Ihe place named the Kourket, Is a ridge 01 hills to the N.W. of Antoura, overlooking, on the west, the sea, which is very near, and towards the south affording a prospect that extends to the roads of Beirout, four leagues distant. The Kourket was soon peopled with monks and nuns. The patriarch for the time being was the director-general. Other offices, great and small, were conferred on divers priests and candidates, who were established in one of the houses. All went on as well as possible. It is true that many nuns died ; but the blame was laid upon the air, and it was difficult to imagine the real cause. Over this litt.e kingdom Hendia reigned for nearly twenty years, when an accident, which could not have been foreseen, upset the whole. One summer s day, a commissioner, coming fx’om Damascus to Beirout, was benighted near this convent. The gates were closed, the hour uuseasonable ;he would not give trouble; so, contenting himself with a little straw lor his bed, he laid down iu the outer-court to wait for day. He had been asleep several hours, when he was awaked by an indistinct noise of doors and bolts. From a door issued three women, bearing shovels and pick-axes, followed by two men, who carried a long white package, which seemed very heavy. The party marched towards a neighbouring piece of ground, full of stones and rubbish. There the men laid down their burden, dug a hole, into which they put it, then covered over the hole, and, after this operation, re-entered the mansion, followed by the females. Men in company with nuns, a sortie made by night, and attended with mystery, a package deposited in a hidden hole,—all this set the traveller a-thinking. Surprise had at first kept him silent; but his reflections soon gave rise to uneasiness and apprehension, and before daybreak he stole away to Beirout. He was acquainted with a merchant in that city, who, some months before, had placed his two daughters at the Kourket, with an endowment of 10,000 livres. He went in search of him, half-undetermined, yet burning with impatience to recount his adventure. They take their seat, cross-legged of course; the long pipe is brought in and lighted ; coffee is served. The merchant makes inquiries respecting his journey, and is told that the traveller passed the night near the Kourket. Particulars are asked ; he gives them : at length, he throws off all reserve, and !־elates to his host all that he saw. The first words astonish him ; on hearing of the load, he becomes uneasy; and this uneasiness is heightened by refiection into alarm. He knows that one of his daughters is ill; he is aware that many nuns have died lately. Tormented with these thoughts, not daring to entertain more serious suspicions, and unable to get rid of them, he mounts his horse, accompanied with a single friend, and they proceed together to the convent. On demanding to see the two novices,*'they are told that they are ill. The merchant insists on their being produced ; it is ungraciously refused ; he becomes peremptory, and they are obstinate, till at length his suspicions are changed into certainty. In the bitterness of despair, he sets off for Deir-el-Kamar, where he lays before Said, the kiaya of the Emir Yousef, the fact with all its circumstances. The minister, struck with the story, gives him a company of horsemen, with an order to obtain admittance either by fair means or by foul. A kadi having now joined the merchant, the affair assumes a legal form. The first thing they do is to remove the earth, when they discover that the buried parcel is a corpse, which the unhappy father recognises as that of his youngest daughter. On forcing their way into the convent, the other is found in prison, at the point of death. She discloses abominations which make the hair stand on end, of which she was just about to ' become a victim, like her sister. The saint is seized : she sustained her part with firmness. They proceeded against the priests and the patriarch ; his enemies united to ruin him, in order to enrich themselves with the spoil; he was suspended, deposed. The affair was brought to Rome in 177 C ; the Propaganda gave information, and discoveries were made of the most infamous px־ofligacy and horrors of cruelty. It was proved that Ilendia destroyed her nuns, sometimes to get their property into her hands, at other times, because they shewed themselves refractory to her orders ; that this woman herself consecrated and said mass ; that under her bed were holes through which perfumes were introduced, while she pretended to have ecstacies and visits of the Holy Spirit; that she had a faction who flattered her vanity, and gave out that she was the Virgin Mary returned to earth, and a thousand other extravagances In spite of all this, she had the address to keep together a party powerful enough to screen her from the severe treatment which she deserved. She was shut up in several convents, from which she frequently managed to escape. In 1783, she was at the visitation of Antoura, and the brother of the Emir of the Druses interested himself on her behalf. A great number of persons still believe in her sanctity (1786), and but for the accidental circurastance of the traveller’s being benighted, even her enemies would have believed it.* “ Within the narrow limits of the Maronite conntry, there are reckoned no fewer than two hundred convents, monasteries, and nunneries.

At above five or six yards from the ground, it was divided into five limbs, each of which was equal to a great tree.” This was in 1696.—Pocockf, one of the most learned and accurate travellers, describes them (in 1738) with greater minuteness. “ The cedars,” he says, &quot; form a grove about a mile in circumference, which consists of some large cedars that are near to one another, a great number of young cedars, and some pines. The great cedars, at seme distance, look like very large spreading oaks; the bodies of the trees are short, dividing at bottom into three or four, some of which, growing* up together for about ten feet, appear something like those Gothic columns which seem to be composed of several pillars. Higher up they begin to spread horizontally. One that had the roundest body, though not ■the largest, measured twenty-four feet in circumference; and another, with a sort of triple body, as described above, and of a triangular figure, measured twelve feet on each side. The young cedars are not easily known from pines : I observed, they bear a greater quantity of fruit than the large ones. The wood does not differ from white deal in appearance, nor does it seem to be harder ; it has a fine smell, but not so fragrant as the juniper of America, which is commonly called cedar; and it also falls short of it in beauty. I took a piece of the wood from a great tree that was blown down by the wind, and left there to rot: there are fifteen large ones standing.” This fallen tree makes up precisely Maundrell’s sixteen, which shews the accuracy of that most honest traveller. “ I observed,” adds Pococke, u that cypress are the only trees that grow towards the top, which, being nipped by the cold, do not grow spirally, but like small oaks ; and it may be concluded that this tree !)ears cold better than any other,” * Possibly, the trees in question are of the species of cypress termed white cedar (Cupressus thy aides), or Arborvitse-leaved cypress. Some species of cypress, according to Pliny, was indigenous to Mount Ida, and grew on its highest point, though covered with snow ; and some of the mountains in Persia are covered with cypress-trees. The cedars grow in a plain between the highest parts of Mount Lebanon, on which the cypress, it seems, is found. It is strange that no other traveller should have noticed this ; especially as the apocryphal book of Ecclesiasticus is a sufficient voucher for the fact that both species were indigenous to these parts : “ I was exalted like a cedar in Libanus, and as a cypress-tree upon the mountains of Hermon.” •ן•"/>

The names of the owners of the silk-worms were all written in this character, in different hands, upon the bags suspended in the church.” From Beshirai, Burckhardt crossed over the higher range of Libanus, in a S.E. direction, to Zahle. At one hour’s distance, he passed the village Hosrun. Three hours and a half further, following the foot of the upper chain of Libanus, he entered the dictnct of Tanurin (Ard Tanurin), so called from a village situated below in the valley. Beyond this, lies the district Ard Laklouk, in which is the Greek village of Akoura. The spots in the mountain susceptible of cultivation in this part, are sown by the inhabitants of Tanurin and Laklouk : such as afford pasture only, are visited by the Arabs of the tribe El Haib, who wander about the district for five months. Some of them even remain here the whole winter, except that in winter they descend from the pastures, and pitch their tents round the villages of Tanurin and Akoura, which are situated in a valley sheltered on every side by the perpendicular sides of the Upper Libanus. Others winter on the coast about Djebail, Tripoli, and Tortosa. &quot; I was astonished,” says Burckhardt, “at seeing so high in the mountain, numerous camels and Arab huts. Though, like the Bedouins, these Arabs have no fixed habitations, their features are not of the true Bedouin cast, and their dialect, though different from that of the peasants, is not a pure Bedouin dialect. They are tributary to the Turkish goveinors, and at peace with the country people; but they have the character of a great propensity to thieving. Their property, besides camels, consists in horses, cows, sheep, and goats. Their chief is Khuder-el- Aisy. The district of Laklouk is compared to some of the pasturages in the Alps. It is covered with grass, and its numerous springs, together with the heavy dews which fall during the summer months, produce a verdure of uncommonly deep tint for Syria. The inhabitants of Akoura are all Greek Catholics, and have a bad name for avarice and inhospitaiity; their property consists in cows, and other cattle, silkworms, and olive plantations.

It is observed on Mount Lebanon, that, in the spring-time, when the snows begin to melt, the waters of the river rise, but the fountains continue as before. After a certain time, the fountains flow plentifully, and the waters of the river abate; and then, the fountains continuing to flow, the waters of the river increase again. The reason of which seems to be, that, when the snows first melt, the water runs down on the surface of the frozen snow, without soaking into the ground to feed the springs ; and so the greatest part of it runs into the rivers. But when the snow is melted towards the lower parts of the mountains, the water begins to be drunk up by the earth, and consequently increases the fountains; and when the earth is almost full of water, and of course does not imbibe so much as before, it then runs more plentifully into the rivers, continning to feed the fountains.”—Travels, book ii. chap 5."/>

The temple faced the west. A grand flight of steps, twelve paces broad, with a column three feet and a half in diameter at each end of the lower step, formed the approach to a spacious pronaos, in which are remains of columns : here a door, six paces in width, opens into the cella, the fallen roof of which now covers the floor, and the side-walls to half their original height only remain. This chamber is thirtyfive paces in length by fifteen in breadth. On each of the side-walls stood six pilasters, of a bad lonic order. At the extremity of the chamber are steps leading to a platform, where the statue of the deity may, perhaps, have stood ; the whole space is here filled up with fragments of columns and walls. The square stones used in the construction of the walls are in general about four or five cubic feet each; but I saw some twelve feet long, four feet high, and four feet in breadth. On the right side of the entrance-door, is a staircase in a wall, leading to the top of the building, and much resembling, in its mode of construction, the staircase in the principal temple of Baalbec. The remains of the capitals of columns betray a very cornipt taste, being badly sculptured, and without any elegance either in design or execution; and the temple seems to have been built in the latest times of paganism, and was, perhaps, subsequently repaired and converted into a church. The stone with which it has been built, is more decayed than that in the ruins at Baalbec, being here more exposed to the inclemency of the weather. No inscriptions were any where visible.

Here there is an Arabic printing-press; but as, on the numerous saints’ days, no work is done, and there is only one press, the progress which is made is very slow.

They had founded, in that city, a seminary, where they exerted themselves in training up the children of Christians in the knowledge of the Roman faith, and of polemical theology. This latter article is always made the main point with these missionaries, and the consequence is a controversial mania, which is perpetually leading to broils between the partisans of different communions in the East. The Latins of Aleppo, instigated by the Jesuits, soon began to dispute, as in former times, with the Greeks. But as logic requires an accurate knowledge of language, and the Christians, excluded from the Mussulman schools, were acquainted only with the vulgar Arabic, they were unable to satisfy their polemical taste by writing. To compass this object, the Latins resolved to initiate themselves into the scientific knowledge of Arabic, The pride of the Mussulman doctors at first refused to lay open their learning to the Infidels ; but their avarice overpowered their scruples, and, for a few purses, this so much boasted science of grammar and the nahou, was introduced among the Christians. The student who distinguished himself most by his progress, was named Abd-allah-Zaker ; who, to his own desire of learning, added an ardent zeal to promulgate his knowledge and his opinions. It is impossible to determine to what length this spirit of making proselytes might have been carried at Aleppo, had not an accident, not unusual in Turkey, disturbed its progress. The schismatics, vexed at the attacks of Abd-allah, endeavoured to procure his ruin at Constautinople. The patriarch, excited by the priests, represented him to the vizier as a dangerous man ; the vizier, accustomed to these disputes, feigned to pay no attention to his complaint; but the patriarch backing his reasons with a few purses, the vizier delivered him a kat-shereef, or warrant of the sultan, which, according to custom, contained an order to cut off Abdallah’s head. Fortunately he received timely warning, and escaped into Lebanon, where his life was in safety; but, in quitting his country, he by no means abandoned his ideas of reformation, and was more resolutely bent than ever on propagating his opinions. This he was able to effect only by writings ; and manuscripts seemed to him an inadequate method. He was no stranger to the advantages of the press, and had the courage to form the three-fold project of writing, founding types, and printing ; he succeeded in this enterprise from the natural goodness of his understanding, and the knowledge he had of the art of engraving, which he had already practised in his profession as a jeweller. He stood in need of an associate, and was lucky enough to find one who entered into his designs. His brother, who was superior at Mar-Hanna, prevailed on him to make that convent his residence ; and from that time, abandoning every other care, he gave himself up entirely to the execution of his project. His zeal and industry were 80 successful, that, in the year 1733, he published the Psalms of David in one volume. His characters were found so correct and beautiful, that even his enemies purchased his book; and since that period, there have been ten impressions of it. New characters have been founded, but nothing has been executed superior to his. They perfectly imitate hand-writing; they express the full and the fine letters, and have not the meagre and straggling appearance of the Arabic characters of Europe. He passed twenty years in this manner, printing different works, w'hich, in general, were translations of our books of devotion. Not that he was acquainted with any of the European languages ; but the Jesuits had already translated several books, and, as their Arabic was extremely bad, he corrected their translations, and often substituted his own version, which is a model of purity and elegance. The Arabic he wrote was remarkable for a clear, precise, and harmonious style, of which that language had been thought incapable; and which proves that, should it ever be cultivated by a learned people, it will become one of the most copious and expressive in the world. After the death of Abd-allah, which happened about 1755, he was succeeded by his piipil, whose successors were the monks of the convent: they have continued to found letters and to print, but the business is at present on the decline, and seems likely to be soon entirely laid aside. The books have but little sale, except the Psalter, which is the classic of the Christian children, and for which there is a continual demand. The expenses are considerable, as the paper comes from Europe, and the labour is very slow. A little art would remedy the first inconvenience, but the latter is radical. The Arabic characters requiring to be conn: cted together, to join them well, and place them in a right line, requires an immense and minute attention. Besides this, as the combination of the letters varies, according as they occur at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end of a word, it is necessary to found a great number of double letters ; by which means the cases being multiplied, can no longer be collected under the hand of a compositor; but he is obliged to run the whole length of a table eighteen feet long, and seek for his letters in nearly nine hundred divisions: hence a loss of time which will never allow Arabic presses to attain the perfection of ours. As for the inconsiderable sale of the books, this must be attributed to the bad choice they have made of them. Instead of giving versions of works of real utility, calculated to awaken a taste for the arts indiscriminately among all the Arabs, they have only translated mystical books peculiar to the Christians, which, by their misanthropic morality, are formed to excite a disgust for all science, and even for life itself.&quot;"/>

These vows are, as everywhere else, those of poverty, obedience, devotion, and chastity; but they are not more strictly observed, it must be confessed, in Syria, than in Europe. The condition of the eastern monks is much harder than that of the monks of Europe, as will appear from the detail of their domestic life. Every day they spend seven hours in prayers at church, and no one is suffered to absent himself. They rise at four o’clock in the morning, go to bed at nine in the evening, and make only two meals, viz., at nine and five. They live perpetually on meagre diet, and hardly allow themselves animal food in the most critical disorders. Like the other Greeks, they have three lents a year, and a multitude of fasts, during which they neither eat eggs, nor milk, nor butter, nor even cheese. Almost the whole year they live on lentils and beans with oil, rice and butter, curds, olives, and a little salt fish. Their bread is a little coarse loaf, badly leavened, which serves two days, and is fresh made only once a week. With this food, they pretend to be less subject to maladies than the peasants; but it must be remarked, that they have all issues in their arms, and many of them are attacked by hernias, owing, as I imagine, to their immoderate use of oil. The lodging of each is a narrow cell, and his whole furniture consists in a mat, a mattress, and a blanket, but no sheets, for of these they have no need, as they sleep with their clothes on. Their clothing is a coarse cotton shirt striped with blue, a pair of drawers, a waistcoat, and a surplice of coarse brown cloth, so stiff and thick, that it will stand upright without a fold. Contrary to the custom of the country, they wear their hair eight inches long, and, instead of a hood, a cylinder of felt, ten inches high, like those of the Turkish cavalry Every one of them, except the superior, the purveyor and the vicar, exercises some trade either necessary or useful to the house; one is a weaver, and weaves the stuffs; another a tailor, and makes their clothes; a third a shoemaker, and makes their shoes ; a fourth a mason, and superintends their buildings.

This t distinction, founded on the schism which broke out in the Mahommedan Church in the year 36 of the Hegira, respecting the caliphate or prophetical succession, is the source of an implacable animosity between the two parties. The followers of Omar, who consider themselves as the only orthodox Moslems, assume the name of Sunnites, which is said to have that meaning, and call their opponents Shi-ites, or sectaries. The word Motouali has the same signification —sectaries of Ali. The Shi-ites call themselves Adli-ites, or justice-ites, on account of certain tenets respecting the justice of God, which they hold in opposition to the Sunnite creed.

After the year 1750, they established themselves among the heights of Bekaa, and got footing in Lebanon, where they obtained lands belonging to the Maronites, almost as far as Beshirai.

In this situation, Sheikh Daher had the address, in 1760, to attach them to his party. The pashas of Seide and Damascus claimed tributes, wdiich they had neglected paying, and complained of several robberies committed on their subjects by the Motoualies; they were desirous of chastising them, but this vengeance was neither certain nor easy. Daher interposed, and, by becoming security for the tribute, and promising to prevent any dcpredations, acquired allies who were able, as it is said. to arm 10,000 horsemen, all resolute and formidable troops. Shortly after, they took possession of Soor, and made this village their principal sea-port. In 1771, they were of great service to Ali Bey and Daher, against the Turks. But Emir Yousef, having, in their absence, armed the Druses, ravaged their country. He was besieging the castle of Djezin, when the Motoualies, returning from Damascus, received intelligence of this invasion. At the relation of the barbarities committed by the Druses, an advanced corps, of only 500 men, were so enraged, that they immediately rushed forward against the enemy, determined to perish in taking vengeance.

The whole seemed to be a piece of admirable sculpture. The measure of the temple within, is forty yards in length, and twenty in breadth. In its walls all round are two rows of pilasters, one above the other; and between the pilasters are niches, which seem to have been designed for the reception of idols. Of these pilasters, there are eight in a row, on each side ; and of the niches, nine. “ About eight yards’ distance from the upper end of the temple, stands part of two fine channelled pillars, which seem to have made a partition in that place, and to have supported a canopy over the throne of the chief idol, whose station appears to have been in a large niche at this end. On that part of the partition which remains, are to be seen carvings in relievo, representing Neptune, tritons, fishes, sea-gods, Arion, and his dolphin, and other marine figures.

They are cut with the bevelled edge exactly like the cutting of the stones in the subterranean columns of the Haram Shereeff at Jerusalem, which Dr. R. supposes to be of Jewish workmanship.* “ Indeed,” he adds, “ the similarity of the workmanship struck me forcibly, and I am disposed to refer them both to the same people, and nearly to the same era. The stones are compact limestone, which is the common stone of the country; and the soil of age with which they are covered, compared with the other parts of the building, which are decidedly Roman, would warrant our referring them to the remote period of eight and twenty hundred years ago, (B.C. 1004,) the era of Solomon, King of Israel and Judah, who built Hamath and Tadmor in the desert. The second builders of this enormous pile have built upon the foundations of the former building, and, in order that the appearance of the whole might seem to be of one date, they have cut a new surface upon the whole stones.

But what is surprising, in the wall to the west of the temple, there are three stones near twenty feet above the ground, each of which is about sixty feet long; the largest of them is about sixty-two feet nine inches in length. On the north side, there are likewise seven very large stones, but not of so great a size.

The place which they occupy in the wall, is nearly on a level with the floor of the interior of the building, and hence they were edged into it by the repairer, who knew no better use for them. The northern part of this outside wall is more modern, and, in my opinion, Roman. The stones are much smaller, and it is vaulted below, to support the floor within. The southern part seems to be banked up with earth and stone, without arches. So much for the shell of this magnificent structure, which has evidently been a wall of defence to protect the precious structures within. These we approach over an arched bridge and many fragments of the ruined walls.

Many fragments of large-grained red granite lie scattered about in different places, and the whole interior of the walls is one continued series of architectural decoration, pilasters and cornices of the most minute w'orkmanship succeeding each other; all round, there have been chapels and niches for setting up images, and places for the votaries to perform their devotions. Besides this preparation for the general rites of pagan idolatry, there are the remains of several temples lor the rites of particular deities. One of these is seen from the road over a breach in the wall; it is peripteral and hypethral, and appears at one time to have been used as a Christian church; both columns and walls still remain. Of another temple there are only six columns, and of others merely the substructions. On the north side of the building there are several apartments, which were probably used for the accommodation of the hierarchy.

Under the Romans, in the time of Augustus, it is referred to as a garrisoned place; and an inscription remains, which proves this to have been the fact, for the words in Greek letters, Kenturia prima, are still legible. A hundred and forty years after this period, Antoninus Pius built the present temple in the place of the more ancient one, which had, no doubt, fallen to ruin. But when, in the reign of Constantine, the Christian religion had acquired the ascendancy, the modern temple was at first neglected, then converted into a church, of which there yet remains a wall that concealed the sanctuary of the idol. The church existed till the Saracen invasion: the Arabs probably envied the Christians so noble a possession.. In the subsequent wars, it was converted into a place of defence. On the outer wall, on the pavilions, and at the angles, were built the battlements which are still to be seen; and from that period, the temple fell rapidly into decay.” What, indeed, with earthquakes and the Turks, it is only a wonder that so much standing of this majestic pile. part 11.

Speaking of the great temple, he says: “ The several members of the columns and pedestals of the pilasters, both within and without, are carried all round the building, and the whole temple is built as on one solid basement. The ground is risen near to the top of this basement, both within and without, except on the south side without, where the basement is seen in all its proportions. The architecture of the sides within, and of the further end, is of two kinds, that of the main body of the temple being in one style; but the small pillars that support the pediments are only supposed : those places seem to have been designed for statues. I went down into the vault, under this part by the light of wax candles ; they consist of two rooms. Going into the inner vault, I was startled to see a dead body lie in its clothes; the murder was committed about six months before by a Greek for the sake of his money, and the body was never removed. The entablatures of the temple, both within and without, are exceedingly rich; in the quarter-round of the cornice without, there are spouts, carved with a lip and flowers that do not project; and the frieze is adorned with festoons, supported by heads of some animal. Nothing can be imagined more exquisite than the door-case to the temple ; almost every member of it is adorned with the finest carvings of flowers and fruits; the frieze, particularly, with ears of corn, most beautifully executed. The top of the door-case consists of three stones ; the middle stone is finely adorned with reiiefs. Possibly, the eagle which is carved on the doorcase might represent the Sun, to whom this temple was dedicated; the winged persons on each side of it may signify the Zephyrs, or air, which operates with it; and by the several other particulars may be figured, that the sun produces fruitful seasons and plenty. The caduceus which the eagle has in its claws, may be an emblem of commerce and riches, which are the consequence of this bounty of nature."/>

They privately chip the pillars, for the purpose of undermining them ; and when they fall, the stones are so large, that they can carry away but very few of them. The pillars of the portico before the temple are ruined, except four at the south-east corner, and four of the pillars on the south side are fallen. There is likewise a wall built across the portico before the temple, insomuch that a great part of the beauty of it is destroyed; and yet the admiration of every one must be greatly raised, who has the least taste for architecture, and considers all the particular parts of it. It appears that the temple was converted into a church by the Christians."/>

It seems to be part of a grand temple which was never finished; the entrance is very magnificent, consisting of two grand courts, encompassed with buildings. This temple, which seems to have been designed in a very fine taste, is sixty-eight paces north of the other, and extends further to the west, very near to the city walls. Several stones of these buildings are left rough, and others are only marked out to be hewn into bases, or other forms; which is a plain proof that this temple was never finished. As the other temple was dedicated to the Sun, so it is probable, this was erected in honour of all the gods of Heliopolis, from an inscription which I saw on one of the basements of the colonnade at the front of the entrance. (DIIS HEL. VI.) This temple stands on higher ground than the other, the bottom of its basement being nearly as high as the top of the other; the wall of the basement is left rough, and seems designed either to have been adorned with all the members of a pedestal, or to have been joined by some other building. It is twenty-seven feet above the ground on the side next to the old temple. There now remain but nine pillars, each consisting of only one stone; they support an entablature, which is very grand, but exactly of the same architecture as that of the other temple, except that, in the quarter-round of the cornice, lions’ heads are cut, as spouts for the water. I measured the top of a base of one of the pillars, on which there was no column, and found it seven feet ten inches in diameter. They are eight feet and an inch apart, so that the inter-columniation is but little more than one diameter, of which I believe there are few instances; what is called the pycnostyle, which is a diameter and a half, being the least that is mentioned by the ancients. To the west of the nine pillars is the base of a tenth and in a line from it, I saw the bases of pillars across, which shewed the end of the colonnade; and by the measures, I imagine it consisted of ten pillars in breadth: some of the broken ones are still remaining on their bases. To the east of the nine pillars, I found that there were six more in the same row, so that there were in all sixteen in length, and I had reason to conclude that there were no more; so that this temple was nearly in the same proportion as the other, which has eight pillars in breadth, and fourteen in length."/>

The spaces on each side were doubtless designed for some apartments, of which there are remains to the north. There are pedestals in the front, which seem to have been designed for statues, being too small for pillars. If there had been a colonnade, this building would have very much resembled the design of Bernini, executed at the Louvre. There is a square pavilion at each end, and the rooms within are adorned with the same architecture as the walls in front. This magnificent entrance is at least twenty feet above the ground to the east, and, without doubt, a grand flight of stairs was designed to it, the foundation wall having been left rough between the two pavilions; and, in De la Roque’s time, there seem to have been steps to this terrace. This grand entrance leads to a court, which seems to have been an octagon of unequal sides, of which there is very little remaining. Beyond this, is a large court of an oblong-square figure. On each side of the middle of the court, there are remains of two low wralls, adorned with the members of a pedestal. They have doors through them, and it is probable there was a magnificent colonnade on them, leading to the grand temple; and this colonnade seems to have been standing in De la Roque’s time, who says, there was a double row of pillars, which formed porticoes or galleries sixty fathoms long, and eight broad. Under these buildings, on each side of the two courts, is a long arcade; there is also a cross one under the buildings, which divides those courts. The arcade to the south seems to have been a private entrance to both the temples; it leads to the area near the north-east corner of the old temple; the other is a way to go round the walls of the city, which there set in to the south. In these arcades, I saAv two busts in mezzo-relievo; one was very singular, being the face of a young person, with bull’s horns coming out of his shoulders, and a particular relief at the bottom, something like a coronet reversed. All these buildings in later times were turned into a castle, and an addition was made of a very strong building near the south-east corner of the old temple, and another to the south-west on the town-wall, which they have almost destroyed for the sake of the stones. It is said, this fortress was demolished by Feckerdine; and mounds of unburnt brick still remain in some parts, which were put up in the breaches, and against the walls, as if they were designed to resist the force of cannon.”"/>

Squire, “ and without the line of its terrace, is a smaller tempie, whose sides are tolerably perfect, presenting a striking specimen of the Corinthian order of architecture. The long sides of the temple, north and south, are about 120 feet in length; the short sides 70. It is surrounded by a corridor, composed of fluted pillars, supporting a roof fourteen feet wide, carved and executed in a most elaborate manner. It is divided into compartments, and ornamented with the sculptured portraits of princes and queens. One of these latter, which has fallen, we observed to be of a colossal size, and nourishing an infant at the breast. The roof on the north side is composed of eight large stones, each sixteen feet long, and of the breadth of the corridor: they are cut in a small degree in the form of an arch: the pillars are about thirty feet high, and composed of three stones. On the east side, after creeping through an opening in a wall, apparently built by the Saracens, we arrived at the portal of the (great) temple, of magnificent workmanship. This entrance is about twenty-five, feet high, and twenty feet in width: on each side are lines of sculpture, representing small figures intertwined with garlands of flowers and fruits: parallel to these again is a variety of ornaments. On the under part of the architrave of this entrance is the representation, in bas-relief, of an eagle with expanded wings, grasping a sort of caduceus, the emblem of majesty, and holding in its mouth the joined ends of two festoons, each of which, at the other end, is held by a figure representing a youth with wings, the festoons are enriched with different sorts of fruits and flowers; and the north side is in the most perfect preservation. This architrave is composed of three stones, the centre one of which has fallen at least four feet below the others, in consequence of an earthquake. The roof of this temple is entirely destroyed; the interior, however, surrounded by niches richly ornamented, with handsome pediments, sufficiently indicates its former magnificence. From the remains of plaster on the walls, it appears that this building was once used as a church. The columns within, with a rich entablature, produce a fine effect; and they are tinged with a reddish yellow.” Burckhardt had visited the ruins of Palmyra only a few months before he came to Baalbec. His impression was, that the first view of Palmyra as a whole, when it first breaks upon the traveller, is infinitely more striking, but there is not any one spot in those ruins so imposing as the interior view of the temple of Baalbec. The temple of the Sun at Tadmor is upon a grander scale, but it is choked up with Arab houses, and the architecture is decidedly inferior. At Baalbec he observed, he says, no Greek, inscriptions, but a few in Latin* and in Arabic, and one in Cufic characters on the side of a staircase leading into some subterranean chambers below the small temple, which the Emir has walled up to prevent a search for hidden treasures. “ The walls of the ancient city may still be traced, and include a larger space than the present town ever occupied, even in its most flourishing state. Its circuit may be between three and four miles. On the eastern and northern sides, the gates of the modern town, formed in the ancient wall, still remains entire; especially the northern gate, which is a narrow arch, comparatively very small. I suppose it,” he adds, “tobe of Saracen origin.”"/>

The tradition is, that the water was conveyed from this pillar to the top of the famous temple, on which the people are so weak as to imagine there was a garden; but it is most probable that the rain waters were conveyed from the building, which I suppose to have been here, into this small basin, and ran down the channel, which was probably covered so as to make it a tube, and might be conveyed to some part of the city, possibly to the temple, where it might be necessary to raise the water to a certain height; or it might relate to some machinery of the ancient superstition.”"/>

Amid its ruins, he says, are two handsome mosques and a fine bath. Lieut.-Col. Squire, describing its appearance a few years before, says. “ Only one-fifth part of the original enclosure of Baalbec appears to be inhabited, and that part is towards the south-east. The whole town presents a most wretched appearance, as the principal part ot the hovels have been destroyed by earthquakes, which, it appears, very frequently occur.

He, therefore, after plundering every house he had possession of, took advantage of a dark night, embarked on board a small vessel, and landed at Cyprus.”—Walpole's Continuation of Memoirs, p. 294."/>

On the approach of Yousef, at the head of an army 5000 strong, all the inhabitants fled to the mountains, except the French consul, who was the secret enemy of Berber. The Pasha’s troops took possession of the abandoned town, and so completely sacked it, that they left nothing but bare walls: every piece of iron was earned off, and even the marble pavements were torn up and sold. The son of the French consul is stated to have gained a considerable sum by buying up part of the plunder. Siege was now laid to the castle, and some French artillerymen having been brought from Cyprus, a breach was soon made; but, though defended by only 150 men, none had the courage to advance to the assault. After a siege of five months, Solieman Pasha of Acre interceded for Berber; and Yousef, in Feb. 1809, glad of a pretext for retiring, granted the garrison an honourable capitulation, the remaining provisions in the castle being purchased by the Pasha for his troops. Berber retired to Acre under the protection of Solieman, who, the following year, was invested with the pashalic of Tripoli, and appointed Berber his aga. In 1812, Seid Solieman Pasha of Damascus held the government of Tripoli; and Berber was, at the time of Burckhardt’s journey, making war upon some rebel Enzairies in the neighbourhood of Latakia.* The city of Tripoli, now called Tarabolos, is built on the declivity of the lowest hills of the Libanus, about half an hour from the sea-shore.

The north side of the triangle is about one mile in extent; the southern about three fourths of a mile; each is bounded by the sea. On the flat promontory, on the north side of which is the place of anchorage, is the Marina, of the size of a small town, where the vessels discharge and receive their cargoes.” Maundrell’s account seems rather discordant, as he places a hill between the city and the sea. “ The major part of the city,” he says “ lies between two hills; one on the east, on which is a castle commanding the place, another on the west, between the city and the sea. This latter is said to have been at first raised, and to be still increased, by the daily accession of sand blown to it from the shore; upon which occasion there goes a prophecy, that the w'hole city shall in time be buried with this sandy hill.

Lieut.-Colonel Squire found it in a ruined and wretched state in 1802; but Burckhardt (in 1812) says, “ it has lately been put into complete repair by Berber Aga.&quot; Many parts of Tripoli bear marks of the age of the Cmsaders; among these are several high arcades of Gothic architecture, under which the streets run. At a short distance east of the citadel, on the same side of the river, is a convent of demises, in one of the most agreeable situations that can be imagined : it is close to the Kadesha, in a deep valley, surrounded with orange and mulberry groves, besides poplars and many other trees and shrubs, which render the air fragrant, and the coup-d'oeil exceedingly picturesque. Tripoli, indeed, is pronounced by Burckhardt to be one of the most favoured spots in all Syria, as the maritime plain and neighbouring mountains place every variety of climate within a short distance of the inhabitants. The wady Kadesha, he thought one of the most picturesque valleys he had ever seen. Yet the situation, beautiful as it is, is not deemed healthy. “ From July to September,” says Volney, “ epidemic fevers prevail here, as at Scanderoon and at Cyprus. They are owing to the practice of inundating the gardens, in order to water the mulberrytrees, that they may be invigorated sufficiently to put forth a second foliage. Moreover,” continues Volney, “ the town being open only towards the west, the air has no circulation, and a constant feeling of lassitude is experienced, which renders health there nothing beyond convalescence. The air, though moister at the Marina, is more salubrious there; no doubt because it is less confined, being renewed by the currents. It is still more so in the islands; and were the place in the hands of a vigilant government, it is there that the whole population should be transplanted. All that would be necessary in that case, would be, to extend to the village the conduits of water which appear to have existed formerly. It may be worth while to remark, that the southern shore of the little plain is covered with vestiges of habitations and broken columns, buried in the earth, or covered with sand by the sea. The Franks employed many of these in the construction of their walls, where they still may be seen, placed edgeways.”"/>

The fact is, that there are still two distinct towns; El Mina, or the port, which occupies the extreme angle of the promontory, being a small town by itself, and it has clearly been an ancient site. Pococke remarks that, by building a wall across the promontory on the east side of the city, it might easily have been fortified; and the remains of such a wall may actually be traced : “ it appears to have been fifteen feet thick, and seems to have been thrown down by force.” Wherever the ground is dug in this direction, the foundations of houses and walls are discovered. “ Indeed,” remarks Burckhardt, “it is with stones thus procured that the houses in the Mina are built.” Whether the third town was on the southern side of the plain,* where Volney noticed extensive ruins, or higher up, in the mountains, can only be conjectured.

Their service consisted in precipitate and very irreverent chattering of certain prayers and hymns to our blessed Saviour and to the blessed Virgin, and in some dark ceremonies. The priest that officiated spent at least one-third part of his time in compassing the altar, and perfuming it with a pot of incense, and then going all round the congregation, flinging his incensepot backward and forward, and tendering its smoke, with three repeated vibrations, to every person present. Towards the end of the service, there was brought into the body of the church, a small table, covered with a fair linen cloth, on which were placed five small cakes of bread cross-way, of this o 0 form © , and in the centre of each cake was fixed O O a small lighted wax taper, a hole in the cake serving for a socket.

After which, the bread was carried into the cancelli, and being there suddenly broken.to bits, was again brought out in a basket, and presented to every one in the assembly, that he might take a little. After this collation, the priest pronounced the blessing, and so the service ended.

These you find in like manner in most churches of this country. Their use is for the priest to lean upon; the service being sometimes so long, that they cannot well stay it out without the assistance of such easements; for they are not permitted by their rubric to sit down. The younger monks, who perhaps may have no great occasion for these supporters, do yet delight to use them, (as the Spaniards do spectacles,) not for any necessity, but in affectation of gravity. “ The monks of this convent were, as I remember, forty in all. We found them seemingly a very goodnatured and industrious, but certainly a very ignorant people. For I found, upon inquiry, they could not give any manner of rationale of their own divine service. And to shew their extreme simplicity, I cannot omit one compliment made to the consul by the chief of them, viz. that he was as glad to see him as if he had beheld the Messiah himself coming in person to make a visit to him. Nor is this ignorance to be much wondered at; for what intervals of time they have between their hours of devotion, they are forced to spend, not in study, but in managing of their flocks, cultivating their land, pruning their vineyards, and other labours of husbandry, which they accomplish with their own hands. This toil they are obliged to undergo, not only to provide for their own sustenance, but also that they may be able to satisfy the unreasonable exactions which the greedy Turks, upon every pretence they can invent, are ready to impose upon them. But that it may be the better guessed what sort of men these Greek monks are, I will add this further indication, viz. that the same person whom we saw officiating at the altar in his embroidered sacerdotal robe, brought us the next day, on his own back, a kid and a goat’s skin of wine, as a present from the convent.”"/>

There were remains of a large church and a monastery, both perfectly ruinous; but no trace was left of the ancient walls, nor was there even a village on the spot. The rocky cliff’s appeared to have been “ much worked with the tool; ” and Pococke observed “a sort of canal cut between them from the sea, running N. and S., which probably might serve for a harbour for boats and small vessels"/>

An artificial shelter seems to have been anciently formed by excavating the rocks, and forming a part of them into a wall of moderate thickness for the length of 100 paces, and to the height of twelve feet.

Djordjos Bas resided at Deir-el-Kamer. The district of Djebail was under the command of Abd-el-Ahad, who built a very good house here. But the two brothers shared the fate of all Christians who attempt to rise above their sphere; they were both put to death in the same hour by the Emir’s orders.

Abd-el- Hak, at Antioch, Hanna Kubbe, at Ladakie, Karaly, at Aleppo, are all examples of this remark.

Ascending the castle hill to the S. of the former town, he arrived in an hour and a half at Deir Keftein. The road lay through a wood of olive-trees, on the left bank of the Kadesha, over the lowest declivities of the Libanus. It is a part of the district El Koura, the principal produce of which is oil. The Zawye on the other side of the Kadesha, also produces oil, and at the same time more giain. Every olive-tree is worth from fifteen to twenty piastres. The soil in which the trees grow, is regularly ploughed, but nothing is sown between the trees, as it is found that any other vegetation diminishes the quantity of olives. The ground round the stem is covered with earth to the height of two or three feet, to prevent the sun from hurting the roots, and to give them the full benefit of the rains. Keftein is a small Greek convent near a village of the same name : it then contained only a prior and two monks. In the burying-ground attached to it is a fine marble sarcophagus, erected over the remains of John Carew, Esq., of Pembrokeshire, for fifty years English consul at Tripoli: he died in 1747, aged seventy-seven. At one hour from Keftein is the village Beserma. The road continues to lie through the olive plantations called El BeJceya, between the Upper Libanus and Djebel Kella, to Refer Akka, three quarters of an hour further. Here Burckhardt turned up into the Libanus, and, in twenty minutes from where he left the road, reached the remains of an ancient town, which it was his object to visit. The ruins are called by the natives Naous, or Namous; probably from the Greek T־ aos. They consist of two temples. The smaller one is very much like that at Hossn-el-Forsul, near Zahle: it is an oblong building, constructed of large square stones, and had a portico of four columns, with a flight of steps leading up to it. The other temple is of much larger dimensions; it stands at about 150 yards’ distance, in an area fifty paces in breadth by sixty in length, and was surrounded with a wall, of which traces still remain, built with large blocks of well-cut stone, some of them upwards of twelve feet in length. To support the northern wall of the area, a terrace has been raised, ten feet high in the N.W. corner. Parts of the wall are evidently modern, as if it had undergone repairs. The entrance to the area is through a beautiful gate, still entire, fourteen feet high and ten wide: the two posts, which are elegantly sculptured, and the soffit, are each formed of a single stone. The temple was elevated four or five feet above the level of the area; it is now a mere heap of ruins, and the ground is covered with columns, capitals, and friezes. The stone is calcareous, not so hard as the rock of Baalbec; the columns are Corinthian, but not of the best workmanship. Near the S.W. angle are the foundations of a small insulated building.

A little further, about a league from the shore, is the island of Ruad, supposed to be the Arvad, Arpad, or Arphad of the Scriptures,* the Aradus of the Greeks and Romans. All around the Serpent Fountain, and for some distance southward of it, are considerable traces of foundations and ruins, and ancient sepulchres; “ from which it may assuredly be concluded,” remarks that traveller, “ that here must needs have been some famous habitation in ancient times: but whether this might be the Ximyra laid down by Strabo hereabouts, (the same, possibly, with the country of Zemarites, mentioned in conjunction with the Arvadites,'b) I leave to others to discuss.” Pococke supsoses that this is the Enydra of Strabo, which was the north of Marathus; and the similarity of the name may be thought to favour his conjecture. “ Probably,” he adds, “it was the watering-place on the continent for the isle of Aradus.” To the south of this is what the learned traveller characterises as “ one of the greatest and most extraordinary pieces of antiquity that are to be seen.” A court, fifty yards square, has been cut in the natural rock; the sides of the rock, about three yards high, supplying the place of walls, except on the north, where it is open.

The whole structure is about twenty feet high, and fronts the open side of the court. At the two inner angles of the area, there seem to have been two small apartments: pillars of the natural rock have been left here, apparently for doorways. There can be little doubt that this court was, as Maundrell supposes, an idol temple, and the pile in the centre the idol’s throne. “It seems the more probable,” he remarks, “in regard that Hercules, i. e. the Sun, the great abomination of the Phenicians, was wont to be adored in an open ternpie.” Here we have a remarkable trace of the same superstition that travelled from India to Egypt, from Egypt to Phenicia, and from Phenicia to Britain. The Egyptian Memnon, the Indian Jain Eswara, the gigantic image reared by Nebuchadnezzar in the plain of Dura, the huge wicker image in which the Druids burned human victims in sacrifice to Beli, and the Syrian Baal, were all, probably, the same deity, who, under the names of On, Osiris, Adonis, Baal, Hercules, has been the object of almost universal idolatry."/>

One part is cut into a small area, from which there is a way into the valley directly opposite to the temple. “ This place might serve,” remarks Pococke, “ for s3me sports to divert the people of Aradus and Antaradus ; and, probably, it was a circus.” Directly south of the temple, the rocks, which rise higher in that part, have been worked like quarries, and sunk down in many places, possibly as reservoirs for water.

This was a very ancient structure, and probably a place of sepulture.” A little to the east of the first-mentioned towers, the rock has been cut into the form of a pedestal, about twenty-eight feet square and nine feet high :on the E. side, about five feet from the ground, is a hole by which there is an ascent of three or four steps to the top. “ This seems,” says Pococke, “ to have been designed as a basement for some building over a sepulchral grotto. All these sepulchral monuments were erected over the grots in which they deposited the bodies; and this might be the burial-place of Aradus, though it is a little to the S. of that island. The people probably brought all their dead over to the continent, as those of the Isle of Delos carried theirs to another island near, which was allotted for that purpose.” The island of Ruad, which Maundrell saw only from the shore, is described by him as wholly filled up with tall buildings like castles. Pococke went over to it, and his account is as follows: “ There is a very safe road for the shipping to the east of the island, where they can fix their anchors on the shore. The ships, without doubt, formerly came up close to the east side of it, for there are two piers, built out to defend them against the Aveather; and a small cape of the island is a natural shelter from the south wind. There seems to have been a double wall to the north and Mrest sides of the island, but, on the south, I saw only the signs of one wall: these walls were fifty paces apart• There are .still great remains of the outer wall, which, on the north side is very high, and about fifteen feet thick, being built 01' large stones, some of them fifteen feet long. It is possible, that some of the smaller shipping and the boats might be laid up between these walls.* The rock to the west is worked out like a wall; and there are reliefs on it of a cross and a crosier. In every part of this island there were cisterns hewn out of the rock, like cellars, under their houses, with holes in the top of them, in order to draw up the water. Strabo makes mention of these, and of some basins near the wall. On the north there are remains of two sides of a rusticated building, the walls of which are three feet thick: it seems to have been built about the same time as Tortosa. There are very few houses on the island, except in the two castles, which are defended by cannon against the corsairs. The shipping that come here, take in tobacco, of which a great quantity is grown on the continent: they carry it to Egypt. When there is not a supply, they load with wood for that country.” Pococke mentions a wood on the continent, nearly opposite the island. He was informed, that the Maltese had possession of Ruad in the preceding (seventeenth) century, and that it was taken from them by surprise at night. He visited it in 1738. Volney, about fifty years after, speaks of the island as a mere rock, entirely naked and deserted. “ There does not remain,” he says, “ a single wall of that crowd of houses which, according to Strabo, were built with more stories than those at Rome itself.” It was reckoned twenty stadia from the continent, and seven * A similar mode of artificial shelter was adopted at Batroun.

It is at present (1697) uninhabited, but its situation proves it to have been anciently pleasant; its ruins are well built, and its bay before it an advantageous situation.” It seems, however, Pococke thinks, to have been but an inconsiderable town. Towards the E. side are ruins of a small church, and a little higher up the hill are ruins of a strong castle. At the bottom of the hill is another castle, commanding the bay, “ where they receive the customs of goods imported.” Pococke found the site still entirely deserted. To the S.E. of Baneas, on the top of a very high hill, is an old castle, called by the Turks Merkab, the Margath of Adrichomius. “It is about half a mile in circumference, occupying the whole summit of the mountain; it is of a triangular figure, and exceedingly strong; the inner walls are fifteen feet thick, and there is an outer wall encompassing it all round, except in one part, where its natural situation is so strong as to render it unnecessary. At the east and west ends are two very large round towers, each encompassing a small court. They have a tradition, that this castle was a work of the Franks, and it was certainly held by the knights of Jerusalem. The governor said to us, ‘ This fabric was raised by your fathers, and we took it by the sword.’ To which answer was made, ‘lt is true, and you suffer so fine a building to run to ruin.’ The truth is, the whole or part of it was built under the Greek emperors, and the bishops of Balanea were obliged to translate their see to this place, to secure themselves against the. Saracens. The church, which is towards the east end of the castle, is well built, mostly of a black stone; it is adorned with semicircular pillars of the Corinthian order, tolerably well executed. Adjoining it, on the east, are some large rooms and a private chapel; and to the west, a large saloon arched over, and supported by pillars in a very magnificent manner. Under the buildings are great vaults or cisterns cut out of the rock; and out of these that black stone was hewn, of which the greatest part of the castle is built.” The road up to the castle, is a very steep ascent of an hour and a half from Baneas; but the traveller leaves it on his right within a quarter of an hour of reaching that place, which Maundrell makes “ four good hours” from Jebilee.

Close by the mosque is a very beautiful bagnio, and a small grove of orange-trees, under the shade of which travellers are wont to pitch their tents in the summer time. The Turks that were our conductors into the mosque, entertained us with a long story of this Sultan Ibrahim, who lies there interred ; especially touching his mortification and renouncing the world.

This they would have to be Sultan Ibrahim’s oratory, it being the manner of the Turks always to make such niches in their mosques and other places of devotion, to denote the southern quarter of the world; for that way the Mussulmans are obliged to set their faces when they pray, in reverence to the tomb of their prophet. These niches are always formed exactly resembling those usually made for statues, both in their size, fabric, and every circumstance. I have sometimes reflected for what reason the Turks should appoint such marks to direct their faces toward in prayer; and if I may be allowed to conjecture, I believe they did it at first in testimony of their iconoclastic principle, and to express to them both the reality of the Divine presence there, and at the same time also its invisibility. The relaters of this story of Sultan Ibrahim were doubtless fully persuaded of the truth of it themselves. But we could not tell what conjectures to make of it, having never met with any account of such a sultan, but only from this rude tradition. From these Mahommedan sanctuaries, our guide pretended to carry us to a Christian church, about two furlongs out of town on the south side. When we came to it, we found it nothing but a small grotto in a rock by the sea shore, open on the side towards the sea, and having a rude pile of stones erected in it for an altar.

He wrote a book, in which, among other things, is a declaration to the following effect: ‘I, such a one, of the village of Nasar, have seen Christ, who is the Wox־d of God, who is Achmed, the son of Mohammed, the son of Hanafa, of the race of Ali, who is also Gabriel; and he said to me, Thou art he who readeth with understanding; thou art the man that speaketh truth ; thou art the camel that preserveth the Faithful from wrath ; thou art the beast of burden that carrieth their load; thou art the (holy) spirit and John the son of Zachariah : go and preach, that men should make four genuflections in praying; to wit, two before the sun-rising, and two before sunset, with the face turned towards Jerusalem, saying three times, God almighty, God most high, God most great; that they observe only the second and third festivals; that they fast only two days in the year; that they drink no beer, but as much wine as they choose ; and that they abstain from the flesh of carnivorous animals.'

M. Niebuhr gives a different account altogether. Through a Maronite, named Antun Beitar, interpreter to M. de Masseyk, he procured the sight of a manuscript said to have been copied by a Jesuit, from a book found in the house of a Druse, where the Jesuit passed a night. This, it must be admitted, is not the most unsuspicious channel of information; but it seems as respectable a source as that from which the above tale has been drawn. The account of the Druses contained in the said manuscript, substantially agrees with that which we have given on other authorities. With regard to the Nassarians, the author of the manuscript states, that they were formerly Druses, but that a certain Nassari had seduced them into a denial of the divinity of Hakem, substituting in his room Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, son-in-law of Mahommed, whom they adored as God ; that this deceiver, moreover, taught them, that the Divinity had resided in twelve imaums of the house of Ali, but that having disappeared with Mahommed el Mochdi, the last of these imaums, it had now taken up its residence in the sun. The same Druse author further states, that the Nassarians believe in metempsychosis; that they even hold, that the soul of a believer of their sect passes, after death, into another Nassarian, and then, after a certain time, enters into a star; but that if any one has been unruly and disobedient to the precepts of Ali, his soul passes into the body of a Jew, a Sunnite, or a Christian, and undergoes repeated changes, till it becomes sufficiently purified to attain at last transformation into a star; while the souls of unbelievers, who worship not Ali Ibn Abi Taleb, pass into camels, mules, asses, dogs, sheep, and other animals."/>

D. 891,) must clearly be fictitious; and at all events, the story of the old man is quite at variance with some of the particulais given by Niebuhr respecting the opinions of the sect. It appears, moreover, that, like the Motoualies, they are of the Shi-ite persuasion, but, as Niebuhr con jectures, of a different sect from them, being the followers of a certain Seid Abu Shaib (Shehab?), who had for an opponent one Ishak, who attempted his life, and whose memory the Nassarians consequently hold in the greatest detestation. Possibly, he adds, the Motoualies may be Ishakians. The origin of their name seems still doubtful.

On certain days of the year, he says, the Ismaylys are generally reported to mix in promiscuous debauchery. But his infor!nation was also hearsay. “ Not only European travellers and Europeans resident in Syria,” he adds, “ but many natives of influence have endeavoured to penetrate the mysteries of these idolaters without success; and several causes combine to make it probable that their doctrines will long remain unknown. The principal reason is, that few individuals among them become acquainted with the most important and secret tenets of their faith, the generality contenting themselves with the obsen־ance of some exterior practices, while the arcana are possessed by the select few. It is true, that all the different sects possess books which they regard as sacred, but they are intelligible only to the initiated. Another difficulty arises from the extreme caution of the Ismaylys upon this subject. Whenever they are obliged to visit any part of the countiy under the Turkish government, they assume the character of Mussulmans, being well aware that, if they should be detected in the practice of any rite contrary to the Turkish religion, their hypocrisy in affecting to follow the latter would no longer be tolerated; and their being once clearly known to be pagans, which they are only suspected to be at present, would expose them to the heaviest exactions, and might even be followed by their total expulsion or extirpation. When they go to Hamah, they pray in the mosque, which they never do at Kalaat Maszyad. This castle has been from undent times their chief seat. One of them asserted that his religion descended from Ismayl the son of Abraham, and that the Ismaylys had been in possession of the castle since the time of El Melekel־Dhaher, as acknowledged by the firmauns of the Porte. A few years since, they were driven out of it by the Anzeyrys, in consequence of a most daring act of treachery. The Anzeyrys and Ismaylys have always been at enmity; the consequence, perhaps, of some religious differences. In 1807, a tribe of the former, having quarrelled with their chief, quitted their abode in their mountains, and applied to the Emir of Maszyad for an asylum. The latter, glad of an opportunity to divide the strength of his enemies, readily granted the request; and about three hundred, with their Sheikh Mahmoud, settled at Maszyad, the Emir carrying his hospitality so far as to order several families to quit the place, for the purpose of affording room for the new settlers. For several months all was tranquil, till one day, when the greater part of the people were at work in the fields, the Anzeyrys, at a given signal, killed the Emir and his son in the castle, and then fell upon the Ismaylys who had remained in their houses, sparing no one they could find, and plundering at the same time the whole town. On the following day, the Anzeyrys were joined by great numbers of their countrymen, which proved that their pretended emigration had been a deep-laid plot; and the circumstance of its being kept a secret for three months by so great a number, serves to shew the character of the people. About three hundred Ismaylys perished on this occasion : the families who had escaped in the sack of the town, fled to Hamah, Homs, and Tripoli, and their treacherous enemies successfully attacked three other Ismayly castles in the mountain. The Ismaylys then implored the protection of Yousef Pasha, at that time governor of Damascus, who marched with four or five thousand men against the Anzeyrys, retook the castles which had belonged to the Ismaylys, but kept the whole of the plunder of the Anzeyrys to himself. This castle of Maszyad, with a garrison of forty men, resisted his whole army for three months."/>

The chief, who resides in the castle, is styled emir; his name is Zogherby, of the family of Solieman. He informed me that his family had been possessors of the emirship from remote times, and that they are recognised as such by express firmauns from the Porte. Zogherby is a nephew of Mustafa, the emir who was slain by the Anzeyrys. Some of his relations command in the Ismayly castles of El Kadmous, El Kohf, El Aleyka, and El Merkab, in the mountains towards Ladakie. After what has lately taken place, it may be presumed that the hatred between the two nations is extreme: they are, apparently, at peace, but many secret murders are committed. ‘ Do you suppose,’ said a handsome young man to me, while his eyes flashed with anger, ‘ that these whiskers shall turn grey before I shall have taken my revenge for a slaughtered wife, and two infant children?’ But the Ismaylyv are weak; Ido no think that they can muster eight hundred firelocks, while the Anzeyrys are triple that number.” Burckhardt passed a night at an Anzeyry village named Shennyn, betwefen Maszyad and Tripoli; and as his hosts appeared to be good-natured people, he entered after supper into conversation with them, with a view to obtain some information respecting their religious tenets, but upon this point they maintained an extreme reserve. “ I had heard,” he says, “ that the Anzeyrys maintained from time to time some communication with the East Indies, and that there was a temple belonging to their sect, to which they occasionally sent messengers. In the course of our conversation, I said that I knew there were some Anzeyrys in the East Indies. They were greatly amazed at this, and inquired how I had obtained my information; and their countenances seemed to indicate that there was some truth in my assertion. It is a fact, that they entertain the curious belief, that the soul ought to quit the dying person’s body by the mouth; and they are extremely cautious against any accident which they imagine may prevent it from taking that road. For this reason, whenever the government of Ladakie or Tripoli condemns an Anzeyry to death, his relations offer considerable sums that he may be impaled, instead of hanged. I can vouch for the truth of this belief, which proves at least that they have some idea of a future state. It appears that there are Anzeyrys in Anatolia and at Constantinople. Some years ago, a great man of this sect died in the mountain of Antioch; and the water with which his corpse had been washed, was carefully put into bottles, and sent to Constantinople and Asia Minor.”"/>

The temple of Aphaca was not the only place in which the Syrian Venus had her altars of abomination.f But idolatrous rites of any description are so incompatible with either the Sunnite or the Shi-ite faith, that we can scarcely imagine them to be practised by the Anazairies generally, or by any who have embraced the mystical creed avowed in their sacred books.

In the mountains, preference is given to the cultivation of the vine, the mulberry, the olive, and the fig, while the maritime border is devoted to tobacco, and the neighbourhood of Aleppo to the pistachio-tree.

The immense property of Tshelebi’s family, added to his personal qualities, gave him such an ascendancy, that he compelled several pashas, who would not fall in with his counsels, to quit the town ; hut, though repeated offers of the pashalic were made him by the Porte, he would never accept of the office. His interests were in some measure supported by the janissaries, the regular militia of the Porte. Through his influence at Constantinople, Ibrahim Bey, one of his household officers, had been, appointed mutsellim of the town, and mohassel, or chief custom-house officer of the pashalic. On the death of Tshelebi, in 1786, his power devolved upon Ibrahim. About that time, Kussa Pasha was nominated to the pashalic, and being jealous of Ibrahim’s influence, he endeavoured to obtain possession of his person, by ordering him to be detained, during a visit made by Ibrahim to compliment the Pasha on his arrival, for a debt claimed by a foreign merchant, who had preferred his complaint to the Pasha. Ibrahim paid the debt, and was no sooner out of the Pasha’s immediate reach, than he entered into a league with the chief of the janissaries against Kussa.

In 1804, the pashalic of Damascus, vacant by Djezzar’s death, was again conferred on Ibrahim, and he obtained that of Aleppo for his son Mahommed Pasha. It was under his government that the janissaries broke out into open rebellion. They began by massacring between two and three hundred of the Pasha’s troops, and at length, after several months’ daily fighting in the streets, they compelled Mahommed to evacuate the city, under pretence of marching against the rebel Berber. Instead, however, of proceeding to Tripoli, he established his head-quarters at Sheikh Abou Beker, a monastery of dervises within a mile of Aleppo, where he prepared to besiege the town. A compromise at length took place, and the Pasha re-entered the city; but, in three months, the civil war broke out afresh, and Mahommed was again compelled to retreat to his former encampment, while the shereefs and the janissaries contended for the possession of the town. This civil war lasted for nearly two years, during which the janissaries never ventured to meet the Pasha’s troops on the outside ot the walls, and the shereefs, who had got possession of the castle, shewed as little disposition to make a sally. They contented themselves with firing into the jannissaries’ quarter, and a considerable part of the town was laid in ruins. At length, Mahommed was recalled by a firmaun from the Porte, on which the jannissaries came to a compromise with the shereefs, and have since then been absolute masters of the city. The Porte has continued to nominate its pashas, but they have possessed nothing but the empty title, being unable to carry the most frilling orders into effect, without purchasing the concurrence of the chiefs of the janissaries.

Each protector receives from his client a sum proportionate to the circumstances of his client’s affairs. It varies from 20 to 2,000 piastres a-year; besides which, whenever the protector terminates an important business to the client’s wishes, he expects some extraordinary reward. 111086 janissaries who have the greatest number of clients, are of course the richest and have the greatest influence. These are not the only means which they employ to extort money. They monopolise the trade of most of the articles of consumption, which have risen in consequence to nearly double the price they bore six years ago, as well as of several of the manufactures : upon others they levy heavy taxes. In short, their power is despotic and oppressive; yet they have hitherto abstained from making, like the pashas, avanias upon individuals by open force, and it is for this reason that the greater part of the Aleppines do not wish for the return of a pasha. Though the janissaries extort from the public, by direct and indirect means, more than the pashas ever did by their avanias, yet, each individual discharges the burthen imposed upon him more readily, because he is confident ' that it insures the remainder of his fortune. In the pashas’ time living was cheaper, and regular taxes not oppressive ; but the pasha would, upon the most frivolous pretexts, order a man of property to be thrown into prison, and demand the sacrifice of one fourth of his fortune to grant him his deliverance. Notwithstanding the immense incomes of the chief janissaries, they live poorly, without indulging themselves in the usual luxuries of Turks—women and horses. Their gains are hoarded in gold coin.” Burckhardt adds, what seems hardly credible, that the yearly income of several of them could not amount to less than 30 or 40,000/. sterling."/>

The space within this circle is composed of a few sloping hills and numerous hillocks, intersected by plains and little valleys. The soil in some of the plains is of a reddish or black colour, rich and fertile, but, in general, it is whitish, shallow, and mixed with small stones. The high grounds are, for the most part, thinly covered with this poor whitish mould, and in many places towards the summit, they exhibit the bare chalky rock. The river Kowik glides with a slow and silent current westward of the city. This river, which rises near Aintab, at the foot of Mount Taurus, enters the boundary of Aleppo by a narrow valley a little below the village Heylan, and, after several windings through the gardens, arrives at the King’s Meidan, within three miles of the city to the N.W. It then flows in a south-easterly direction till within a quarter of a mile of one of the western gates, when it makes a sudden turn eastward, and passing under a bridge near that gate, after a course of about a third of a mile, turns off towards the hills, and runs S. through a cultivated valley. By the time it reaches Aleppo, it is reduced to a small stream, by being drained of large quantities of water in its way, for the use of the gardens ; so that in the summer, its channel below the gardens is usually almost dry. But in the winter, when much snow has fallen to the northward, or when the rains are heavy, it swells to a formidable river, overflowing occasionally the lower grounds and the bridges. At such seasons, vast flocks of storks take possession of the gardens; they are otherwise seldom seen, except in straggling parties. In the time of the Crusades, A.D. 1123, the sudden rise of the waters proved fatal to the Christians who were besieging Aleppo. After the siege had continued eight days, and the place was on the point of surrendering, the river rose unexpectedly, and overflowing its banks, carried away the tents, destroying a great number of men, together with baggage and effects to an immense value.

The dulaman is tucked up so as to shew part of the waistcoat. They are made of plain or flowered stuff, chiefly of home manufacture: in the summer they wear India kermazoofs, calico, or muslin. No ligatures of any kind are used, except round the middle, which is girt with a belt under the waistcoat, and with a long Persian shawl above the dulaman, in which is worn the small daggei (hanjar), or knife (.sikkeen), fastened by a silver chain.

Persons who walk on foot, wear one fur only, or, at most, two, and, instead of the kurk, an outer gaiment of cloth, called a kurtak or benish.

The mosques, the minarets, and the numerous cupolas, form a splendid spectacle; and the flat roofs of the houses on the hills, rising one behind another, present a succession of hanging terraces, interspersed with cypress and poplar trees, the foilage of which, contrasted with the dazzling whiteness of the numerous minarets, has a very picturesque effect.

The fear that they may not cease before the rainy season commences, has induced those whose business cannot allow of their quitting the ruins of their towns, instead of rebuilding their houses, to construct temporary hovels of wood without the walls: and many families, who thought themselves, before this calamity, straitly lodged in a dozen apartments, now exult at the prospect of passing the winter in a single room, twenty feet square. The houses of the public agents and private European individuals at Aleppo, have been entirely ruined. At Aleppo, the Jews suffered the most, on account of their quarter being badly built, with narrow lanes. Out of a population"/>

When it is considered, that two-thirds of the families in Aleppo have neither the means of making a long journey, to remove to a town out of the effect of the earthquake, nor of building a shed to keep off the rain, it is impossible to conceive all the misery to which they are doomed the ensuing winter, or ever to find more deserving objects of the compassion and charity of the opulent, whom it has pleased God to place in happier regions of the globe.

The wounds of affliction must bleed afresh, when I recal to my memory the lamentations of fathers for their children, of children for their fathers, of husbands for their wives, and of wives for their husbands—running naked from place to place imploring the protection of the Almighty ; or, with their feeble bands, trying, amidst the falling ruins, to extricate themselves and their relations. “ I was at that time asleep on the terrace of my particular friend Mr. Maseyk; who, by the help of the Almighty, was mercifully saved, with all his family. About half an hour previous to the great shock, a light one was felt, when I took the precaution to draw my bed from under a very high wall, where it was placed. I was soon awakened by the fall of that wall, on the very spot where my bed had stood. I sprang from my couch, and, without waiting to dress myself, fled into the house, which I found falling on all sides. To remain in the house, or to take to flight through the streets, amidst falling houses, appeared to be equally dangerous. I recommended my soul to God, and embraced the latter resolution. In consequence, I descended the backstairs of Mr. Maseyk’s house, by the Almighty’s guidance, for the great stair-case fell at the same time. The darkness of the night, and the clouds of dust that covered the atmosphere, prevented me from perceiving the stones and rubbish on the stairs, which had fallen from a part of the house, and, consequently, I was precipitated into the court-yard on a dead body. How can I express my feelings at that moment, ignorant on what body I had fallen ! I was half dead with fright and horror. I afterwards learnt that it was a faithful servant, who a second before had descended those stairs, when some stones of an adjoining Turkish house fell on him and killed him. I quitted that melancholy spot, and, like a man deprived of his senses, ran, amidst the falling walls, to the gate of the town, which is situated at some distance from my friend’s house. It was on my road, among narrow streets, that I was destined to witness the most horrible of all scenes. The lights of the houses whose sides had fallen, exposed to my view men and women clinging to the ruined walls of their houses, holding their children in their trembling arms mangled bodies lying under my feet—while piercing cries of half-buried people assailed my ears. Christians, Jews, and Turks, were imploring the Almighty’s mercy in their respective tongues, who a minute before did not perhaps acknowledge him."/>

But the gate of the city was shut; and no one dared to risk his life under its arch to open it. After recommending my soul again to my Creator, I threw myself on the gate. I felt in the dark, and perceived that it was not locked; but the great iron bars that went across the folding-doors, were bent by the earthquake, and the little strength which I retained, was not sufficient to force them. I went in quest of the guards, but they were no more ! I fell again on my knees before the Almighty, who alone could save me from the immediate peril of being crushed to death. I did not forget in my prayers the miserable creatures around me. While I was in that attitude, four or five Turks came near me, and joined hands to pray in their accustomed way, calling out, ‘ Allah ! Allah!’ Having in sight my own safety, and that of thousands of individuals who crowded to the gate to escape, I made no more reflections, but began to entreat them in the name of Cod, to help me to open the gate, in order to save our lives, and those of so many individuals who were continually perishing before us. “ The Lord inspired them with courage; and, providing themselves with large stones, according to my instructions, in a little time they forced the bars, and opened the gate. No sooner had I quitted it, than a strong shock of an earthquake crumbled it to pieces, and several Jews were killed by its fall. A new and affecting scene was now exhibited. A great concourse of people rushed out, and with one accord fell on their knees, to render thanks to the Almighty for their preservation; but, when the first transports of joy were over, the thought of having left buried, or in danger of being buried, in the city, their friends and relations, made them pour forth such piercing lamentations, that the most hard-hearted person would have been penetrated with grief."/>

When I recovered a little my senses, I began to feel new sufferings, of a nature too poignant to be described. The thoughts of what might have befallen my brother and his family, who were at Antioch, and the cruel fate of my friends in the city, besides the melancholy objects around me—people wrounded, others lamenting the death of their relations, others having before them their dying children, taken from under the ruins—preyed so strongly on my mind, that not the pen of the ablest writer can give an adequate idea of my feelings. I spent the whole night in prayer and anxiety. Early the next morning, I was conveyed by some charitable people, on an ass, to the nearest garden, to profit by the shade of the trees. I did not remain long, before M. Derehe, the French dragoman, joined me, and gave me the agreeable news, that all the European Christians, excepting a little boy, had been saved; but many, like myself, were greatly bruised. Of the European Jews, the Austrian consul, M. Esdra de Picciotto, and a few others, were crushed to death ; and many thousands of native Christians, Jews, and Turks perished with them. I have now the satisfaction to know that my brother and his family had escaped from a similar danger at Antioch. When I joined the rest of the Europeans in the garden of Ibrahim Aga, I was most kindly received by the French consul, M. Lesseps, who afforded me every possible assistance. I cannot too greatly admire the conduct of this worthy gentleman, in the critical and afflicting position that he is in. A father could not shew more affection to his children, than M. Lesseps manifests to his countrymen, as well as to all those who are in want of his advice or assistance. The next day, my friend M. Maseyk came to live among us ; in the bosom of whose family I begin again to enjoy life, although deprived of all its comforts. My heart bleeds for the poor Europeans, who, without the least prospect of having, for a time, a roof to preserve them from the scorching rays of the sun, must soon, from the heavy rains of the autumn and winter, be deprived of every resource; for the few effects which they have been able to save, must be sold for their sustenance.”"/>

Under the middle of an octagon dome are the remains of the famous pillar on which, they say, St. Simon lived for so many years. What remains of it was hewn out of the rock; that is, the pedestal, which is eight feet square, and a very small part of the column. The part of the cross to the east of this was the choir; at the east end of which are three semicircles, where, without doubt, there were three altars, and the entrances to them are adorned with reliefs. This convent was destroyed by a prince of Aleppo, at the latter end of the tenth century.” A number of ruined villages lie in this direction.

Passing the high mountains bounding the plain to the northward, the road continues N.W., and soon brings the traveller in sight of a most magnificent prospect, embracing an immense plain, across which the Orontes winds its serpentine course, entering the valley from the S.W. The road descends to Salkeen, a village on the S. side of the valley, but separated from the river by a ridge of heights; distant three hours from Elmanas. The Orontes is crossed by a stone bridge called Djeser Hadeed, “ the iron bridge,” so named from its gates, which are coated with iron. On the west side of the bridge is a village of Kourds, tributary to the Mutsellim of Antioch. The route from this place lies first N.N.W. and then W.S.W. over uncultivated plains, to Bab Paulos, one of the ancient gates of the old city. Antioch itself is half a mile further; the distance from Djeser Hadeed something less than four hours. About a mile before the traveller reaches Bab Paulos, he observes the remains of an ancient pavement: and for nearly 600 yards, there is a paved road between most pleasant gardens. Immediately within the gate is a clear spring, shaded with trees. This route is given by Lieut.-Col. Squire. Pococke mentions a village called Daina, near where he entered the high road from Aleppo to Antioch. “ The antiquities that remain here,” he says, “ shew that it has been a place of some consideration; especially the great number of sepulchral grots cut down into the rock, which is hollowed out into courts, with several apartments round them : on some, indeed, I saw Christian Greek inscriptions. Among these sepulchres is a very beautiful fabric; a square canopy of stone with its entablature, supported by four lonic pillars on a solid basement. In the skirts of the village there are remains of two houses; one of them is large, with a great enclosure and a tower; the other, which is smaller, has an lonic colonnade in front, both above and below. The cross over the doors, and two Greek inscriptions, shew it to be a Christian building.” This plain the learned traveller considers to be where Aurelian first conquered Zenobia, which was near Imma. Not far from Daina, he passed by two or three “ magnificent ruined villages,” and further, in the road to a village which he calls Tesin, other ruins, and, in one place, a handsome church almost entire. Tesin, he says, is famous for the best oil of olives in the country: here he saw the remains of the front of a church adorned with sculpture, with a defaced Greek inscription. As he passed over the plain in the night, he observed the lightning “ shooting horizontally in the form it is represented in Jupiter’s hand, and on the reverses of the medals of the Greek kings of Syria. “ I took the more notice of it,” he says, “as I never saw it in that manner in any other country; and, without doubt, from this they took the figure of it as it is seen on the medals.” Captains Irby and Mangles, who took the same route in 1817, mention a considerable site called Bourkee, where the ancient sepul* chral caves serve the present natives for their habitations. “We passed,” they say, “ many sites of ancient towns, castles, tanks, temples, &amp;c., all of the Lower Empire, and very uninteresting: on one occasion, we counted eleven sites in a rich plain, with a very fine loamy soil, now left desolate and uninhabited.

There were no battlements to the wall, but there was a walk on the top of it; and where there was any ascent, the top of the wall was made in steps, so that they could go all round the city on the walls with the greatest case; and it is probable, there were such steps also on the walls which were built up the very steep precipices from the iron gate, where all is now in ruins; and by this wall of communication, they without doubt went from one hill to the other. The steps on the walls were very convenient, for that hill is so steep, that I rode four miles round to the S.E, in order to ascend the hill without difficulty.

The luxuriant variety of foliage was prodigious; and the rich green myrtle, which was very plentiful, contrasted with the colour of the road, the soil of which was a dark red gravel, made us imagine we were riding through pleasure-grounds. The laurel, laurestinus, bay-tree, figtree, wild vine, plane-tree, English sycamore, arbutus, both common and andrachne, dwarf oak, &amp;c., were scattered in all directions.

It is a small natural amphitheatre on the declivity of the mountains, where the springs burst with a loud noise from the earth, and, running in a variety of directions for the distance of about two hundred yards, terminate in two beautiful cascades, about thirty feet in height, falling into the valley of the Orontes. Instead of a magnificent temple, surrounded with stately groves of laurels and cypresses, I saw three or four wretched water-mills built of mud, and a few dwarf myrtle bushes intermingled with brambles. The largest of the fountains rises from under a vertical rock, forming a small abyss, or concavity, on the top and sides of which the massy remnants of an ancient edifice, perhaps those of the Temple of Apollo, attracted my attention. A considerable portion of the water of this spring is conveyed for nearly two miles through an artificial subterraneous aqueduct, which I was told had been traced to the vicinity of Antioch.

It is situated about a mile from the sea, on the south-west side of a rocky mountain. The walls on the S. side were built on high cliffs overlooking the plain; to the west, on the brow of a steep descent, over the bed of a mountain torrent that runs southward into the plain ; to the north, on high cliffs over the bed of the same torrent. There is a descent within the walls from the N. E., N.W., and E.; and a steep descent on the E. side without the walls, at the bottom of which a “ natural fosse” is formed by the deep bed of a winter torrent. Here there was a double wall: the outer one, consisting of very large stones, was ten feet thick; the inner wall, built of hewn stone, was defended by square turrets fifty paces apart. In the plain near the S.W. corner of the city, there was a fine basin walled round, designed to receive the shipping: it communicates by a narrow channel with the sea. To the north of this channel, on a gentle rising ground, is a tower which protected the port. On the south side of the entrance there was another tower, built on the rock; and near this, a pier runs into the sea, about 67 paces long, and 18 paces wide : it is constructed of very large stones, some of them 20 feet long by six feet in width, and five in depth ; they have been fastened together by iron cramps, the marks of which are still to be seen. A little way to the north of this, is another pier, 120 paces long, and fifteen paces broad. On the S.E. side of the city was a strong gate, adorned with pilasters, and defended with round towers. This was almost entire at the time of Pococke’s visit, and is called the Antioch gate. The city communicated with the sea by an artificial channel cut out of the rock. “Itis a passage from fourteen to eighteen feet wide; the first part from the E., for 260 paces in length, and about 40 in height, is cut under the foot of the mountain ; the rest, which is about 820 paces in length, is sunk down from fifteen to about twenty feet in the solid rock, and is open at top; it ends at the sea. The last part is cut down lower, and great pieces of rock are left across the passage, to make the entrance difficult, there being a path left only on one side, which might be closed on any occasion. It is not cut with steps, as Polybius describes it. Along the sides are small channels to convey water from the higher parts to the ground which is to the south of it. This extraordinary channel ends a little way to the north of the northern pier. The water formerly ran through it, but now it does not go that way, unless after great floods. It is said, that the Arabs turned the water to the S.W., where I saw it run by a sort of subterraneous passage. Part of it now runs into the basin, which is choked up and become a morass; and the water at present goes in two small streams into the sea, one through the channel of the basin, and the other to the S.W. of it."/>

They call it the convent of Codryllus; and it was, probably, the hermitage of some Christian of that name. Above this, near a quarter of a mile to the east of the city walls, is a sepulchral grotto, over the door of which is a relief cut in the rock, representing a woman sitting in a chair, leaning her head on her right hand, as in a melancholy posture; before her stands a child. On one side is another relief, in which a woman is giving something to her child. This, probably, was a sepulchre made for a beloved daughter.

It was resorted to in the time of the Crusades. The custom of thus corresponding with Aleppo from Scanderoon, is mentioned by D’Arvieux and Maillet.

Thus commerce was obstructed on every side. To these serious political drawbacks, Volney adds a formidable natural disadvantage of the situation, for which the government is not responsible; the prevalence, during winter, of a peculiar wind, called by the French sailors le raguier (the chafer?), which, rushing like a torrent from the snowy summits, forces ships to drag their anchors several leagues : he even states, that, during three or four months, the winds from the land prevent any vessels from entering the port, ־b Yet, inconvenient as it is, this, he says, is the only part of the coast where there is a solid bottom, and vessels may anchor without their cables being liable to chafe.

He is probably the person alluded to by Burckhardt as the independent aga of Alexandretta. In 1813, the town contained about sixty Greek families and thirty Turks, and the trade was confined to a few boat-loads of rice and salt from Daraietta. Captain Macdonald Kinneir ascribes the ruin of its commerce to the expedition to Egypt—at which time all the Franks were expelled together with the depreciation of the Turkish currency. Latakia had at that time become the port of Aleppo, yet, its trade was also trifling, the exports consisting of sugar and rice from Egypt, wines from Cyprus, oranges from Tripoli and a few bales of woollen cloth from Smyrna. “The commerce of Aleppo,” adds this enterprising traveller, “ has within these few years past been entirely ruined, in consequence of the depreciation of the currency and the enhanced price of European commodities; the people have no longer the means of purchasing them, and for a hundred bales of cloth formerly imported into Aleppo, and distributed among the neighbouring cities, not a tenth part of that quantity is now consumed. The population and agriculture of the country are fast declining; the cities, falling to decay, lie half buried in their own ruins, and the oppressed and distracted peasantry either flee for safety into the mountains, or look forward with a languid hope to a change of their condition.

At four hours from Sekeylibie, the Orontes is crossed by a bridge of thirteen arches, to Kalaat Seidjar, a castle apparently of the Saracen times; “ but it should seem,” says Burckhardt, “ from the many remains of Grecian architecture found in the castle, that a Greek town formerly stood here.” * lie searched in vain for Greek inscriptions, but saw some Arabic ones.

Hamah is a considerable town, situated on both sides of the Orontes, part of it being built on a declivity, part in the plain. It must contain, Burckhardt says, at least 30,000 inhabitants; of whom the Greek families, according to the information he obtained from the bishop, are about 300. In the middle of the city is a square mound on which formerly stood the castle. The houses, a few “ palaces” excepted, have mud walls ; but their interior is stated to make amends for the roughness of their appearance. There are thirteen mosques; the largest has a very ancient minaret. There are four bridges over the Orontes. The greatest curiosity at Hamah is the hydraulic wheels (naoura), which supply the upper town with water: there are about a dozen of them; the largest is at least seventy feet in diameter. By means of these wheels are raised buckets, which empty themselves into stone aqueducts supported by lofty arches on a level with the hill. There are no remains of antiquity of any interest. The principal trade of Hamah is with the Arabs of the Desert, who come to buy their tent furniture and woollen abbas. The Pasha of Damascus has usually 3 or 400 horsemen stationed here, to keep them in check. Burckhardt had an interview here, in 1812, with the celebrated Nassif Pasha,* who had built a very handsome house at Hamah, and enjoyed an income of about 8,000/, sterling. In the course of conversation, he made many inquiries concerning the Duke of Sussex, whom he had known in Italy. Several opulent Turkish grandees resided in the town, where they were in some measure removed from the extortions of the government. Abnlfeda, the great Arabian historian and geographer, was Prince or Emir of Hamah, about A.D. 1345, with the title of Sultan. The town, there can be little doubt, occupies the site of the Epiphania of the Greeks, which attained its most flourishing state under the Greek emperors, whose medals are found here. It is also, in all probability, the capital of the country of Hamath, the king of which sent presents to David, and entered into an alliance with him, after he had conquered the king of Zobah.* 'The government of Hamah comprised, in 1812, about 120 inhabited villages, and seventy or eighty ruined or abandoned sites. “ The western part of its territory,” says Burckhardt, “ is the granary of Northern Syria,” though the harvest never yields more than ten for one; chiefly in consequence of the immense numbers of mice, which sometimes destroy whole crops. The river irrigates a number of gardens belonging to Hamah, which, in winter, are generally inundated: those on the higher ground are watered by wheels. In summer, the water of the river is quite clear. From Hamah, it is three days’ journey and a half to Tripoli, by way of Hossn. Burckhardt deviated from the track, to visit Kalaat Maszyad (or Meszyaf), which has already been referred to as the hereditary"/>

El Hossn is a village of about a hundred and fifty houses : it is thirteen hours from Hamah.* Its castle, Burckhardt represents to be one of the finest buildings of the middle ages that he ever saw. It is evidently of European construction; the walls are very regularly constructed, and are ornamented in many places with high Gothic arches projecting several feet. Over the gate are carved lions, the armorial bearing of the Count of Thoulouse. “ The inner castle, which is seventy paces in breadth, and 120 in length, is defended by bastions. A broad staircase under a lofty arched passage, leads up from the gate into the castle, and was accessible to horsemen. In the interior we particularly admired a large saloon of the best Gothic architecture, with arches intersecting each other on the roof. In the middle of a court-yard we noticed a round pavement, about a foot and a half from the ground, and eighteen paces in diameter; it is called El Sofra, the table. There are many smaller apartments in the castle, and several Gothic chambers, most of which are in perfect preservation. Outside the castle an aqueduct is still standing, into which the rain-water from the neighbouring hills was conducted by various channels, and conveyed by the aqueduct into the castle ditch. Figures of lions are seen in various places on the outer wall, as well as Arabic inscriptions, in which the name of El- Melek-el-Dhaher is distinguished. There are roses sculptured over the entrance of several apartments. An aga resides in the castle, with a few men for its defence. If Syria should ever again become the theatre"/>

About half-way, where the Orontes, diminished to a paltry stream, is crossed by a bridge of thirteen arches, is the village of Rastan, or Restoun, near which are the ruins of a large convent: the bridge, a water-mill, a cascade, the khan, the village on the eminence, and a few trees on the immediate bank of the river, render it rather a picturesque spot. Part of the walls of an ancient site, the line of the streets, and some pedestals, are all that remain of the Arethusa of the Itinerary. From this spot, it is a desert tract to Homs. Here there is nothing remarkable, except a Roman sepulchre. about a furlong to the west of the town; supposed, from an imperfect Greek inscription, to have been erected to the memory of Cains Caesar. It is built of brick, and consists of two stories, of five pilasters on each side; the lower story Doric, the upper lonic ; each story about nine feet four inches high; surmounted with a pyramidal roof, which, within, is a cone. In the ceiling of the lower arched room, which U thirty feet square, Pococke saw some fine reliefs in stucco. The present town takes up only a quarter of the space contained within the ancient walls, which date, apparently, from the time of the Saracens. There is a large ruined castle on a high round mount, faced with stone, and encompassed with a deep fosse, to the S. of the town. The historians tell us, that in this city, St. John the Baptist’s head was found in the reign of the Emperor Theodosius; here Hippocrates resided; of this city the infamous Heliogabalus was a native; and near it, Aurelian defeated Zenobia, the famous queen of Palmyra. John the Baptist’s head, the temple of the Sun, and all the monuments of Aurelian’s victory, have alike vanished. But Palmyra remains, unrivalled, though in ruins."/>
